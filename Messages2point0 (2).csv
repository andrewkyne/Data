In 2014, he said that he sometimes drinks coffee during the baseball season.[123] Though serving a mission is strongly encouraged for male members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who are between the ages of 18 and 26, it is not required. Harper decided his mission rested on the diamond. In a 2016 interview, he said, ""Coming up to the draft and trying to make that decision, I always thought that my Heavenly Father upstairs always just wanted me to be a walking Book of Mormon, you could say,"" [...] ""I knew that I could touch a lot of people's lives playing and trying to be the best Mormon that I can be on and off the field.""[124]",1681345978,4/13/2023 0:32

Season start: Thurs, March 30
Tentative end: Fri, August 11

There are a good amount of off days (11 plus the All-Star break), though six of them have seven MLB games / 14 MLB teams playing (two teams below the threshold), so it's possible that a makeup/rescheduled MLB game could allow us to play on some of those days. In that case, we will take a game from the end of the schedule and play it that day.

As always, there are 36 three-game series to start the season (108 total games) and then 12 straight individual matchups to balance the schedule and end the season. ",1679167455,3/18/2023 19:24

6367062,President - Top Half Manager Committee (2nd term),"(1/2) I first starting by downloading a spreadsheet off the ‚Äúplayers‚Äù tab in fantrax. I downloaded two spreadsheets. One from the 2022 fantasy season for total points and then another spreadsheet for the 2023 season projections. Yes, I said projections. From analyzing numerous websites, it was very challenging to find a website that used the same points system as us. 

From there, I started off by taking the top 18 players by each team based on overall rank. I took that data and made a list from lowest overall sum to highest overall sum. The lower value, the better team. 

I then took a step back and realized that top 18 was too large of a sample size here. Most teams should have a solid 10 starting field players and then at least 2 solid pitchers, therefore I decided to compile the data based on top 12 players

20856010,Austin Johnston,"(2/2) I think players 13-18 are important, but they aren't really used when 14 games are played in one day. I know people won't be happy with that, which is why I really put effort into comparing top 18 when the list was made. 

I didn't really factor in 2022 points that much because top players may have missed multiple weeks of the season, which I thought was a big variable to eliminate that data. 

Lastly, I didn't consider contract prices and prospects that may be called up this year. 

Now here we are. The two lists used (below picture). My rankings weren't exactly what's on the picture because as said earlier, I factored in both, but really valued top 12 more",1678806846,3/14/2023 15:14
20856010,Austin Johnston,"(1/2) I first starting by downloading a spreadsheet off the ‚Äúplayers‚Äù tab in fantrax. I downloaded two spreadsheets. One from the 2022 fantasy season for total points and then another spreadsheet for the 2023 season projections. Yes, I said projections. From analyzing numerous websites, it was very challenging to find a website that used the same points system as us. 

From there, I started off by taking the top 18 players by each team based on overall rank. I took that data and made a list from lowest overall sum to highest overall sum. The lower value, the better team. 

I then took a step back and realized that top 18 was too large of a sample size here. Most teams should have a solid 10 starting field players and then at least 2 solid pitchers, therefore I decided to compile the data based on top 12 players

I can create a google sheet that we can leave open for a week and owners can make their arbitration allocations. This is in addition to the standard $3 increases.

24800210,Andrew Kyne,"It's a good competitive balance measure, and a good way to get increases on both high salary guys who we might want to see back in the draft (eg an Ohtani or a Soto) and low salary guys who should have more cap hit (eg a Yordan or a Burnes)",1672159973,12/27/2022 16:52
24800210,Andrew Kyne,"And for clarity, this happens before the usual salary increases. So Corbin Burnes is $6 now, you guys might push him up another $27 to $33, and then he'll get the usual increase to $36.",1672159902,12/27/2022 16:51

24800210,Andrew Kyne,"John, this is in place of the voteoff system. Instead of voting on one player, you'll get $30 to spend. You'll go around to each of the other 9 teams and increase salaries to individual players. However, max of $4 means you can't go over $4 on a specific team -- for example you can't go to Bong and assign all 30 of your dollars to Yordan. But you could do all 4 to him, or maybe 2 to him and 2 to Tatis, etc. You have to assign at least $2 to each team (or perhaps $1) but no more than $4",1672159821,12/27/2022 16:50

23304018,polish hammer,I'm gonna be honest. I need a better understanding of how team allocation impacts player salary increases,1672159537,12/27/2022 16:45
21276439,"Com., Esq.",I would be ok with a minimum of $1 per team,1672159354,12/27/2022 16:42
21276439,"Com., Esq.","We could tinker with the numbers a little. Ottoneu is $25 of allocation per team with at least $1 allocated to each team and a max of $3. 

We could do something like $30 of allocation with at least $2 allocated to each team and max of $4. Could also add that the most that can be allocated to an individual player is $3. 

Bad teams would get $2x9 = $18 of salary added and good teams would get $36 of salary added. More an individual player could increase would be $27.

Then I go to the bathroom in the 5th inning and see him in a stall, EMTs are trying to get him out.
