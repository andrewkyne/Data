Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good," been my experience here that the Reds go over and above in this area. I don't understand anyone having complaints here. If they do, they should try somewhere else."
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,"'- Monthly prizes and incentives
- Maybe select a ""department of the month"" to recognize big accomplishments (ex. sold out star wars - recognize ticketing or marketing for their efforts - give the department a free lunch or something
- Monthly option to select a free piece of reds gear (not an expensive item, maybe a t shirt or hat)"
Culture Analysis,Improve," More town hall meetings. These are helpful & informative. More lunch & learns, The Boys of Summer event was excellent, inspiring, good to get together with other team members. _____says stuff and we have to deal with all of the crappy stuff. He makes a mess and does not talk to us. I like my team, we do a lot of cool stuff, our department is a fun place to work. When the team has a day game away have a Reds luncheon in Bally's. This would be fun team building. Have a raffle for things like who will get the first hit, number  of pitches thrown in the first inning who will hit the first single etc. Schedule some events with the players & coaches. I like the Reds and would really like to meet some of the players & coaches. Schedule a town hall or luncheon just focused on baseball, it would be good to hear from Nick Krall, David Bell, Joey Votto, Johnathan India, etc. Take one day for all of the staff to go to Kings Island , museum, Smale park, etc. for team building, play games. "
Better Place to Work Analysis,Very Good," Overall, I've been pleased and grateful to work in Cincinnati.  "
Morale Analysis,Improve,"- Ownership's unwillingness to spend on players has been not only embarrassing, but detrimental to our careers/earnings here. Some trades are necessary in how baseball operates, but too many in the past few years were 100% obvious payroll reduction trades.  It's sad that our GM has to say we are aligning ""our payroll to our resources"". I'm glad he felt comfortable saying that so he doesn't have to fall on the sword for ownership.\
- I wonder what percentage of employees cannot even see a window or outside while they work here.  I have no idea if it's sunny or raining out.  Sunshine is vital for happiness. I work in a depressing drywall/foam board room in the executive offices.  I might as well work in the basement somewhere. In the winter, I can go a full day without seeing daylight while at work. 
After seeing other sports team's offices, it's depressing coming back to ours.
- The office space in general is very outdated.  Large metal filing cabinets, old linoleum desks, drywall everywhere, fluorescent tube lights. This place needs a major overhaul.  A quick google search of ""modern office design"" would show you what our offices could look like.
- Also, there is no break room here. Nowhere to eat lunch other than our desks or press dining (and no one wants to eat at press dining on non-game days).  The Reds depend on the fact that ""we are a baseball team"" to have high morale. 
- If you don't have a private office, but you need privacy for work or a call, there is nowhere to go. No privacy pods for calls or work. You can try to book one of our one meeting spaces (1B...literally that's it), but if it's booked then good luck.  The irony of 1B being called that when there is not a 1A anymore is amazing.
- The visitors weight room is NOT a good place to work out. It's also closed for about 90+ days out of the year.  Not having decent gym access (despite the Reds Total Rewards saying so), is a huge downside.  Planet Fitness is gross, but I still try to go there.  A staff gym would go a loooong way."
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,"- Something small would be appreciated on each year anniversary.  Shouldn't wait 5 years for a paper weight. Something nice like a Montgomery Inn gift card would go a long way.

- Otherwise, I don't feel the need for recognition by peers or management, but I know others like that so they'd be a better judge than I."
Culture Analysis,Improve,"	We do reviews for staff, but we do not practice/encourage/engage feedback upward
	Implementing 360-degree reviews is not the answer. We must begin with practicing and valuing feedback without retaliation from leadership. 
	To give and receive truly candid feedback, people must feel a sense of safety and trust
If feedback is something that happens only at unusual times (such as a performance review or when somethings gone wrong), it'll never really be an organic part of our culture.
	Leadership ca't just sit back and wait for feedback. If we truly want feedback to take root in the culture, we need to explicitly ask for it over and over and over again. 
	Start small, feedack isn'tpartf o our culture now and it is going to take a while. We must practice giving feedback (positive and negative), and receiving it, and learn how to communicate in an appropriate and collaborative manner.
	To become more effective and fulfilled at work, people need a keen understanding of their impact on others 
Work From Home options supported by leadership
	Trusting employees leads to a positive narrative around working from home
	Our career requires us to work nights and weekend year-round (not just in season). We are happy to flex our schedules to the ever-changing demands of our career. If the organization would recognize and flex to the employees quality of life, that would be wonderful.  
Working from home improves work-life balance, increases productivity, and fosters healthier lifestyle"
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,"
Leadership fires people up and gets them excited and has a way of thanking and recognizing them that is appreciated. "
Culture Analysis,Improve,"""Culture"" seems to be missing at the Reds. No employee acts as if they are extremely excited to be here and there is a lack of energy within the office. 
-More events to pump people up and personalized ""Great job"" messages from leadership to show that employees come first.
-Better recruiting and creation of a sense of belonging for diverse and young talent
-Unconscious bias training and create procedures to reduce workplace gossiping with tenured employees"
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,$$$$ is the most effective way to reward hard work
Culture Analysis,Improve,"1) Lead by example. LIVE the culture you want for the organization.

2) Don't email your employees while on maternity/paternity leave, for any reason. And if you do, do not expect a response. 

3) Hold all staff accountable in a productive and positive manner. We're all adults, and yelling or getting angry typically isn't an effective approach. (I'm not saying it happens often, but I'm not sure why it happens at all.)

4) Create an onboarding process for all employees across the organization. Share it with all managers, hiring managers, etc. A checklist that also identifies who/which department is responsible for doing each task.

5) Create more Business Resource Groups, including a Womens BRG."
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,"1) Leaders need to listen with the intent to learn. (We don't know what we don't know.) Do not interrupt. Do not assume you know the right answer. Trust your employees that are in the trenches doing the work.

2) Embrace the dual income household. Many of our employees have a spouse that stays home, but more are beginning to share the parenting and household duties. Some don't have family in town to help out; some do. Don't assume you know each employee's situation. 

3) Don't intentionally or unintentionally make a working parent feel guilty if they have to leave early to pick up a kid or if they're dealing with a sick child. As managers, you know if your employees are pulling their weight and getting their work done. Don't make snide comments when they're already stressed as it is. Give grace to your employees, and it will likely repay in dividends. 

4) The leadership team needs more diversity (not just race) in order to thrive. There needs to be more differing viewpoints from the top. This goes for the core executive team of four and the leadership group that meets every week.
"
Morale Analysis,Improve/Good,"1) Provide as much job clarity as possible. 

2) Celebrate the wins, both big and small. 

3) Pay entry level employees higher wages. 

4) Learn what makes your employees tick, and do what you can to build upon that. Everyone is motivated by different things.

5) If an employee is ""rewarded"" with additional responsibilities, ensure they are compensated accordingly. 

6) Consider prorated PTO days in the transition year. If an employee started in March, don't make that person wait until January 1 of the following year to receive their additional PTO."
Culture Analysis,Improve,"1. CREATE A WOMEN'S ERG: It is surprising to me that we do not have this already. I would have prioritized this over a working parents group. 

2.	WORK FROM HOME 1 DAY/WEEK: Instill a structured work from home policy for at least 1 day a week & offer more vacation days for entry-level staff. 10 (less than 1 day/month) is not healthy or realistic. The week between Christmas & New Years & national holidays add value, but 10 days to use at your will is not enough & not helpful in recruitment or when trying to avoid burnout.

3.	SUMMER FRIDAYS: For those that work games, having non-gameday Fridays off during the season would go a long way. I know that some other teams do this, and this would allow people to catch up on the time they miss at home throughout the season. 

4.	ENCOURAGE FEEDBACK: I am not asking for more annual/bi-annual reviews. However, we do not have any review processes in place for leadership/executives. I think it would be great to have individuals review the managers that they report to. That said, I am not sure the best way to give leadership feedback without the fear of retaliation/retributions. 

5.	LEADERSHIP TRAINING: Train your leaders on a consistent basis. I believe there are some outside resources that VP-level & higher have been given opportunities. That should be made available to all leadership (or the entire staff) to continue to develop our young leaders & great professionals in general.
"
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,"1. Improve transparency
2. Spend more money on the team
3.Improve marketing to get more fans to games"
Morale Analysis,Improve,"1.	HONEST APPRECIATION: We all work hard & when we are criticized for taking a vacation (joking or not) or aggressively shot down/cussed at while presenting on a topic we have spent countless hours preparing for is not acceptable. Mutual respect & appreciation can go a long way. 

2.	ELIMINATE THE LOCKER ROOM CULTURE/MENTALITY: We all enjoy each other & have a great time, but when this office is referred to as a locker room (when we truly only have access to a locker room for the men in the office) it excludes women & can make everyone uncomfortable.

3.	BE WILLING & OPEN TO CHANGE: This workforce is not the same as it was 20-30 years ago. We need to adapt, or we will fail. 

4.	TRUST YOUR TEAM: There is a lack of trust at the Executive level & this creates a fear-based/CYA culture. I do not trust that the executive leadership at the Reds always has my best interests at heart. At times, they make our jobs harder. We have a lot of very intelligent people running our departments & I wish we placed more faith in them to lead as they see fit. Micromanaging does not do anyone good.

5.	EMPOWER YOUR STAFF: We have great people that work for the Reds. Trust them to manage themselves as adults & get their jobs done in whatever way makes sense for that individual. This can come in the form of working from home, promoting members of their team, flexible office hours, etc.

Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,"A greater emphasis needs to be placed on performance-based rewards. This may vary from employee to employee or department to department, but everyone appreciates when their hard work is acknowledged (although not everyone wants PUBLIC recognition). Some ideas include: a celebratory lunch, an unexpected afternoon off, a handwritten thank you note with a candy bar or a gift card for a coffee (or anything personalized that you know that specific employee would like). It's often more about the thought put into the recognition than anything else."

Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,"A work from home option would be beneficial. With long days & weird hours when the team is in town - it would be nice to be able to catch up on life (laundry - errands etc) while still being available to help clients. It would be much more restful if in the middle of a homestand (like the 10 game set in July) if we could take a day at home between long evenings at the ballpark.

Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,Ability for employees outside of Cinci to visit GABP for a game.
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,"Actuate more cross learning. For example in scouting, an analytics dept person should spend time with a scout on the road for a week a few times a year. They should share their views of the game and teach each other some of the tricks of their trade in order to help one another form both a personal bond, but also a better understanding of the other persons viewpoint. There are surely many beneficial pairings. Also perhaps if an employee would like to learn more about another role within the org that they are interested in, maybe even moving to, we could make that happen. "

Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve,"Address management issues. When departments are losing 30%-50% of their staff in a short time, there is a reason for it. Correct the issue. Not everything is about money. And using the phrases ""it was time for that person to go"" or ""we couldn't compete with that offer"" feels like an excuse. Some people want to feel valued and needed. Even if in the big picture everyone is replaceable, they do not want to hear it. "
Morale Analysis,Improve/Good,Adjust reward system across the board.
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,"After being part of this organization now for a couple of years, I can't really identify what our Reds culture is. It's actually fairly easy to see/observe that our Major League team led by the coaching staff, in particular, have shown a Reds way as they seem to really care about the players & staff as people, putting family first, and always seem earnest to strive to get better through ingenuity as well, but it doesn't always feel that way in other areas. We are a small market team but with a big heart and I'm proud to work with the Reds, especially when we emphasize the impact we are making on the community at-large, but would love to see that family/community applied more to other departments and areas outside the Major League team.

Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,"All items listed above are rushed in presentation.   Slow down and make it memorable!    Christmas and pre-season lunch are always rushed and not heartfelt.   Same format each year on company picnic, christmas lunch, christmas gifts, etc. - mix it up!   Big anniversaries are presented months after the fact.     Birthday and anniversary cards via mail check the box, but when Phil signs it and an HR staff member writes name on top, does not appear heartfelt.

Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,Annual Employee Awards.  There could be several outlined awards each year.  Employees are nominated by their departments.  A committee would then narrow down finalists.  The organization holds an annual ceremony celebrating the finalists and announcing the winner of each award.  Winners would receive an award and a bonus or prize of value.
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,Any acknowledgement is good.
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,"Any reward or recognition feels fake if executive leadership considers your work replaceable, if they can't be bothered to learn long-tenured staff's names.

I would love to hear regular communication showcasing the good work our team does.  Not only the ""thank you"" slides in all staff luncheons, but regular updates throughout the year when goals are met.  For instance: did Corporate Sales hit its goal? Did Ticketing? What kind of projects is Baseball Ops working on? How is IT making us better, faster, more efficient? We should celebrate the work that ties us together.

Additionally, the Reds Rewards statement we got in the mail was the opposite of empowering.   My spouse called it ""gaslighting"". If the organization is proud of how it compensates staff, it shouldn't have to remind them with a detailed statement that even calls a holiday gift part of our compensation."

Morale Analysis,Improve/Good,"Based on the past, I believe the Reds should go back to catering lunch for the staff at least once a month. These lunches allow for departments to interact in a relaxed setting and help build connections.

•	People of Color and women are underrepresented at our VP level

•	The pipeline for amazing diverse talent at our organization isn't empty. When decisions are made that disproportionally affect them, they leave, as we have seen. 
•	It is imperative we are more intentional in our executive leadership decision making process. Creating opportunities for nondominant groups to stay and advance through the ranks and ultimately reach equitable leadership representation at our organizations highest level.

Employees definitely feel the entitlement level within organization - ex:  employee ticket requests - why different levels? - what makes ""Director"" request different than ""Below Director"" request - aren't employee tickets based on availability?

Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,"CONTINUED FROM ABOVE: 3. CELEBRATE PROMOTIONS: The Reds do not celebrate tenure or promotions well. Many anniversaries have come and gone with zero recognition. For some people, who have dedicated a decade plus of their life to this organization, its hard! For those that make it that long, there should be better/consistent recognition. Additionally, when people are promoted, please do not say things like “Oh another REDS promotion – a title & no money!” Its not funny because its often true. It also diminishes the fact that the person promoted EARNED that promotion & probably deserved a raise along with it. We should be so thankful they choose to work here & not somewhere else. Promotions and raises should never be viewed as a gift or leadership “taking care of us”. Promotions and raises are earned through years of hard work and long hours from dedicated, great people."
Morale Analysis,Improve/Good,"CONTINUED FROM ABOVE: Love that we have access to the visiting team workout facility and dont take that for granted but something could be done to either improve it with more modern equipment or to create an employee specific facility for us to use that is open year round for use like many other companies have - another way to improve culture.
Also, not sure which question to address this in, but would love to see a more hard line policy of some sort put in place that keeps random people from walking through the 1st floor to use the bathroom, enter the ballpark, etc... I should not have to sit at my desk behind multiple keyed entry doors and have random people just walking through the office staring at me as I do my job. With all of the mass shootings and wild people in this world it is a bit uneasy knowing random people are gaining access to a private workspace without any real security.
Lastly, continue to look for ways to offer more competitive salaries. The company continues to have turnover from people in both lower and higher level positions due to the burnout referenced above but also largely because of the desire for increased wages.

Culture Analysis,Very Good,Culture from team standpoint is solid. ACR
Culture Analysis,Improve,"Culture is much different across each department of the organization. I think the Reds do a good job of giving department heads the ability to create their own culture. That works really well in departments that have leaders that make culture a priority but does not work when department heads do not prioritize it.  

To strengthen our culture we have to build trust! The fact that many do not believe this is an anonymous is a huge red flag for the organizations health. We have a culture of putting things in writing so we have a track record if we need it and jumping down peoples throats when thigs don't go as planned.  This causes a culture of fear that has been created. 

 A lot of things have changed after covid in the work place as many companies are moving toward hybrid schedules which starts with trust and allows employees to get their work done in a way that they can accommodate their personal schedule. This type of work culture starts with trust and doesn't only judge you if you are here at 8:30 or earlier or 5:30 or later. If we don't adapt to be a more trusting culture we will continue to lose good people. 


To improve culture we need to improve trust and lessen fear. To do that we must hold all leadership responsible to seek feedback, then listen to the feedback without getting defensive. We need to promote/hire leaders who are passionate about growing others and continually working on improving themselves.

Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,Cut down the number of platforms that information is spread over 
Culture Analysis,Improve,"Defining it would be a great start. Vague platitudes and buzzwords are not helpful. We've done workshops where we come up with some adjectives to describe ""Reds Culture"" but those don't turn into meaningful direction because they're too broad. This is a workplace, and establishing a culture means understanding the operational paradigm - the workshop resulted in ""strategic anchors"" of ""alignment"", ""exhaustive preparation"", and ""fearless execution"". But how are those executed?

Which departments need alignment? Internally or externally? What does that look like - is it wider-scale meetings across groups (at which levels?), more consistent/standardized processes, different methods of distributing information, stronger accountability for deviation...there are a lot of things it could mean.

Exhausting ourselves in preparation seems like a bad idea. Even if it's not, what happens when we are still unprepared - do we then have the bandwidth to adjust? How are we determining what to prepare for? How exhaustive is exhaustive? Does this mean we should be slower to pivot because we want to be more focused on accomplishing the goal we've identified and less on whether that's the right goal?

Not sure how fearful people are in execution, but if that exists at all it seems like a huge problem. So the last point is mostly just do your job? Or perhaps we need to make sure we're not creating a culture of fear? Which I agree with, but it'd be a little concerning if that needs to be said."

Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,"During 2020, there seemed to be a real concerted effort to talk about how our organization can support positive social change and attempt to have real dialogue about hard issues facing us. By 2021, those zoom calls, meetings, efforts seemed to have stopped. Also, during 2020, there was an effort by ownership to reach out and be transparent about our organization and the employees place in it, that has also stopped - and both efforts were really appreciated and should be brought back. 

In our particular departments, there doesn't seem to have been a reflection of the rising costs of living & inflation with certain work expenses, that would really help us feel less stressed when doing our jobs to the best of our abilities. 

Also, we are trying to build from within and develop Major League talent through the draft, trades and international free agents, but development seems to be the one area where investment pays off and if don't FULLY invest in all aspects of player development (emphasizing better nutrition, mental health coaches at every level, upgrading facilities, paying coaches for over-time they put in, and investing in more tech/data, etc) then we are not going to get the same return on our investment other competing clubs do.

Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,"Employee recognition is a great thing to do as long as it is properly applied.  Reds Way was a great starting point for employee recognition as the focus was on the game day employee.  It has since expanded into the front office as employees are recognized for exceptional custom service. Most of the recipients are part-time employees and I would like to see us create a recognition for full-time staff.  
This could be something that is celebrated on a larger scale, such as recognizing full-time staff at the OD lunch, holiday luncheon, and other company gatherings. Directors will have the opportunity to recognize an employee(s) for outstanding service to our external/internal customer.  The recognition would be greater than a Red Way reward.

Birthdays/Anniversaries - I would like to see the Reds improve on recognizing employee birthdays and anniversaries.  
Birthdays - treat the employee to lunch at the Holy Grail or a restaurant on the Banks.  Give the employee 1/2 day off on their birthday or the first day they are back at work.
Anniversary - celebrate the milestones at 5 yrs, 10 yr. 15 yr. etc.  Gift card for a dinner for two (share with spouse or close friend), and the day off (paid).  The employees family sacrifices many nights of their loved one working night games, weekends, or events.
Having the opportunity to celebrate a milestone with a loved one is a way of saying thank you to the entire family."
Morale Analysis,Improve/Good,"Employees in my experience get a sense of positive morale when they are paid commensurate with their experience and comparable to their competitors. They want to feel a sense of security, multi year contracts or at least a history of job security based on performance. Finally, morale is strengthened when internal candidates are given opportunities for advancement before external candidates."
Morale Analysis,Improve,"Employees should be rewarded with promotions and rewards when deserved. The organization has created an environment where if you become irreplaceable, you will get stuck in that position without much opportunity for growth.

We should never have our perks taken away at the expense of making money. We earn those perks. The ""big games"" are big to us, too."

Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve,"Empower the talented employees you have to make decision.

Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve,"First of all, thank you for issuing this survey.  Our organization is full of top-down feedback, and is missing a crucial feedback loop from its employees. I appreciate that this is an opportunity for all voices of the organization to be heard.

I love our organization, but it is flawed. We have seen that recently with the number of individuals who have left, especially those who were long tenured or in leadership capacities.   We do not invest in our talent.  Despite having incredible team members on staff, we often make the joke of a ""Reds promotion,"" which is more work for no increased pay.  Additionally, when there has been a vacancy left from someone who has left a leadership role, that has been backfilled by a junior or entry level employee.  The work has either been reallocated to other leaders (who are not provided an increased title or pay), dumped on other more junior staff members, or is left undone altogether.  We have incredible staff that should be invested in when assigned increased workload and responsibility.  

Lastly, I am often told ""we are lucky to work here."" We are. I feel fortunate to work for one of 30 MLB teams. However, the organization is lucky to have us.  We are skilled professionals who are incredibly hard working and dedicate a lot to our work.  We are lean, and incredibly efficient with our time.  The organization is better served from our dedication."
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve,"First of all, when it is said at your company meeting ""turnover is part of this business"" I think that right there tells you that you don't really value the workers you have and that you feel anyone can come in here and do there job.

You don't just let people with 15+ years of service walk because ""turnover is part of the business"". Good companies try everything they can to keep them here. "

Morale has taken a huge hit in recent years with consistent promotions from outside the org.  Significant turnover where we have lost very talented people to other teams that have promoted them to higher positions than what we have.  There has also been a lot  of turnover that has created new directions annually.  We continue to hire part time or intern head counts that are band-aids to real staffing issues.

Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve,"Generally taking better care of employees -- i.e., actually providing quality food options to those employees who are required to stay for games. Crazy idea: not only could we improve press dining in about an infinite number of ways, we could also...wait for it...provide an employee discount on Stadium food options so that people who don't like whatever food might happen to be in press dining that night (likely smothered in mushrooms, lol) could still eat when they are required to be at the ballpark for over 12 hours that day.

Also, I think generally just inspiring a sense of pride for working where you do is important, and I feel we are lacking in that right now. For example, when our scoreboard and game presentation is being out-done by minor league stadiums all across the US, it does not exactly inspire pride to work for the Reds (amongst staff, but also amongst players).

Additionally, this may be an issue that plagues certain departments more than others, but we are understaffed. That impacts our culture and morale in a multitude of ways. For example, I am already at the 5 minute time estimation for this survey and do not have the time to complete it due to having other work to get done because we are understaffed and probably overworked. Additionally, it impacts my next answer (which I've already written, so that will be included here) in that we do not have enough time for team-bonding and cross-departmental mingling.

Employee softball game at GABP once a month. Or maybe even just a round of BP or an opportunity to play catch and have their family at the ballpark for an employee picnic when the team is on the road. Also make sure we have a strong out-reach program for those that want to represent the Reds in the community, but may not have the personal resources to make the impact they can or want to. They can apply for money to make some great things happen in connection with the Reds within their community. Also make sure our own people are very aware that we have people that can help them when they are struggling. Our mental skills coaches are not just for the players for example. And neither is our training staff. For example, April in the Finance dept sits at her desk 7 hours a day. She has an issue with her back. April gets word on Friday that she can visit the team chiro at 11am before lunch. Whaaaat really? Instantly April feels better and knows, the Reds really do have her back.  "

It's so much fun to be a part of this Organization when the team is winning. And I do understand this is ""mostly"" out of ""our"" control.  

When I think of morale and how I feel at work, I think of the people I work with.  I love my co-workers (in my department) and consider them family/friends.  Would be nice if there were other opportunities to get to know people from other departments. Not just see them in the hallways and not get said ""hi!"" to...

Overall, I believe Morale is in a good spot. I do enjoy coming to work and am satisfied with my job, for the most part."

Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,"I agree and think it is important to recognize people in the organization who are doing well. I think there needs to be some level of criteria for why someone gets recognized. How do we measure performance? Is it subjective/objective or both? Keeping people in the organization who we feel like are doing a good job is important, one way to help do that is to offer more multiple year contracts and increased compensation. "
Morale Analysis,Very Good,I already feel good about the work  I do.
Better Place to Work Analysis,Very Good,I am content in my job/ nothing needed.
Culture Analysis,Very Good,I am currently satisfied with the Reds culture. 
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,"I am indifferent to our current rewards and recognition program. While personal recognition is great, I dont see this current system making much of a difference in strengthening our organization. The personalized reward pamphlet which itemized our “rewards & benefits” sort of led to some personal frustration. It was sort of insulting to know that someone considered earned salary and benefits a reward, when it is actually earned through work provided. It made me realize that Human Resources is really disconnected from what employees actually do and how they are compensated, especially compared to other companies, industries, and MLB organizations. "
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,I am not in the office. Not qualified to answer.
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,"I am not sure what the Reds do. Improve by telling us what the program is. Maybe the newsletter is the program. Improve by giving awards for years of service. Is there a way for employees to give other employees gift cards or good job recognition? Some of our staff is really helpful. I say thanks but would like to do more. Start a program for employees to recognize other employees. I recently got a birthday card in the mail signed by Phil. This was a positive surprise, put a big smile on my face. I used the $10 gift card for a birthday dinner. Keep doing this! Start employee of the month recognition & employee of the year recognition. A lot of companies do this. Highlight some of our employees on Reds.com. "
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,I am probably the wrong person to ask this question to as I am not huge into rewards and recognition.  As long as I can make a good living and provide my family with a comfortable lifestyle that is all that matters to me.
Better Place to Work Analysis,Very Good,I am quite content with my workplace environment and the great co-workings I have.
Culture Analysis,Very Good,"I am satisfied with the Reds culture. I feel there is a good balance between desiring success for me as an individual in my career and life, and results for the organization. This is slightly more difficult to grasp working from home, however I think that when I move into the office it will become an even bigger positive to working with the reds."
Morale Analysis,Very Good,I am very pleased with morale and take a lot of pride in what we do.
Culture Analysis,Very Good,I am very pleased with the Reds Culture and enjoy working here very much!
Culture Analysis,Very Good,I appreciate the current culture of the Reds. 
Morale Analysis,Improve,"I appreciate things like the Bats game outing. The job is satisfying when you get to hear stories of fans with great experiences. The only time I'm having a negative attitude about coming into work - is when it just feels like I live at the ballpark/at my desk.

Jokes from leadership about promotions typically being ""title change only"" and ""simply more work/responsibility"" are in very bad taste. Karen's words at the Opening Day luncheon were excellent and more in line with what should be expected."
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,"I believe a way to strengthen the Reds culture is by having faith in people. I have a strong belief that working as a team creates some of the best success in organizations. In doing so, that means having trust in employees that may be new, or employees that are not familiar with how this organization operates. I believe this can help people find confidence in themselves while in their workplace which can be huge WIN now a days. This will build a stronger relationship working with employees at the Cincinnati Reds. "
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,"I believe certain departments create and strengthen the Reds culture through continuity and maintaining a common goal. That being said, Im not sure this culture is consistent or seen from top to bottom across every department. "
Morale Analysis,Improve,"I believe employees enjoy working here - for a while. And the staff works very hard - for a while. But it is not sustainable. For many departments, it feels as though there is no end in sight - other than a week or so during the holidays. It is ALWAYS on to the next thing. It creates burn-out, which in turn creates low morale because workload is not manageable."
Morale Analysis,Improve/Good,"I believe our PTO allowance could be improved as well. Two weeks is 3% of our time working we are able to take off. Many companies are moving to an unlimited PTO. PTO would have to be approved by the manager and there would still be a way to abuse it, but not having to plan out every single day and being able to take an additional 2-3 days would be giant leap in employee morale and culture. 

Please update the nametags on employees offices. Many are outdates with maiden names or are absent for new employees. "
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,I believe that flexing hours is a big asset of working in sports. It is crucial for us employees to have a work/home life balance. 
Morale Analysis,Improve,"I believe that morale is at an all time low right now in my tenure as a Reds employee. I think the simplest way to improve morale is to find ways to make employees feel appreciated and respected. Many employees work very long hours for very low wages and there is an attitude or mindset from many levels of management of ""that's just the way it is"" as opposed to an appreciation to the employee for the hard work. People have low morale currently because overall there is a lack of appreciation of the efforts being put in. Entering into the profession of sports, people are aware of the long hours and lower salaries but the messaging from upper management should be one of appreciation and respect, as opposed to expecting people to be overworked and underpaid. 

To strengthen morale, the messaging needs to change from ""you are lucky to be an employee"" to ""we are lucky to have you as an employee"". Too often when people leave the Reds for other jobs, it is joked about that they are moving on to bigger and better things and making more money with more benefits and freedoms. 

It shouldn't take someone threating to leave to suddenly find more money for their salary, people earn rewards, raises, etc on merit - not just because they threaten to leave. Until people begin to feel that the organization cares about them as a person, the morale will remain low. 

The littlest of things could make big impacts, for example when inflation in the world is pushing 5-7% and we are given a 1% salary increase regardless of how hard we work or have accomplished. The structure of people only getting raises or promotions by request makes the employee feel that their work doesn't matter and thus lower morale. 

One final thing impacting morale is the impact felt by many people that work in sales with decisions made from a roster standpoint and comments/actions that have resulted in negative outcomes. There has not been a conversation or clear and concise messaging to employees showing that upper management understands the financial impact this has had on the general employee and it hasn't been shown that there is remorse for this negative impact. I honestly believe a very honest and real conversation about the situation would help people feel better, more proud and more upbeat about working here. "
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,I believe that the moral has lowered overall due to high turnover rate. I wish that there was more inclusion in the decision making process where applicable. It sometimes feels as if opinions and experience don't factor into decision making. 
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,I believe that the Reward and Recognition from the Reds has been outstanding since I've been working here. They have always recognized when employees are working hard. I do not have any strengths to recommend.  
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,"I believe the ability to Work From Home at my discretion (without hurting the business) should be an option. Hybrid work environments are the future; let's lean into it.  

Would be nice if there was an opportunity for advancement into a management role.  Versus you are either a worker bee or a leader bee. Not much room for leading a team, or learning the hiring process, etc.  For example, I'd love to be on the HYPE Committee (or something similar) and learn how those types of decisions are made.  Maybe it's a rotating committee.

"
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,i believe this is heading in the right direction
Reward & Recognition,Very Good,"I believe this organization does a very fine job in this area. There is genuine thought and respect given to those who have worked here. The gifts, notes and recognition by the Reds is really quite nice."
Morale Analysis,Improve/Good,I believe we need more structure in the workplace. Set realistic goals for employees to accomplish day to day.
Reward & Recognition,Improve,"I can't think of any rewards system we have for positively acknowledging excellent performance. First, the annual reviews need to change. They don't serve our department very well and in my time being here, it's never been used as an award or bonus or used for even a raise. I have not heard that at least. I have only heard it being used to criticize. 

Everything else is fine. Reds Way is viewed primarily as a game day initiative, so if it were a full-time, that should be clearly explained. "
Reward & Recognition,Very Good,I currently do not have any ideas. 
Morale Analysis,Improve,"I definitely get the feeling that a lot of staff - particularly younger staff - don't always feel their opinions are appreciated and truly considered. Now, I personally don't think it's as bad as some of them would have you believe, but the feeling is definitely there. We have to find a way to get some more middle ground at times to make sure everyone feels valued and heard, even if we don't ultimately always go with what they wanted. "
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,I didn't know this was a thing so I have no ideas to strengthen it. I wonder if not every department (non game day duties) is rewarded for their hard work. 
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,"I didn't realized the Reds had an official rewards and recognition program. 

Our staff makes a point to recognize peer to peer success stories and appreciation. We try to encourage staff outing and team-building events when possible. We have a very wonderful staff that is super helpful, reliable and accountable. 
"
Better Place to Work Analysis,Very Good,"I do think that the Reds is already a great place to work! That being said, I do have a few suggestions:
1) Develop a formal ""how-to"" for employees and new hires. Examples- How to book a conference room, How to reach out to IT for assistance (submit a ""Help"" ticket, etc.), How to request employee tickets, How to view HR/Payroll information (payroll schedules, etc.). 
2) Implement a chat feature for employees to communicate. Being able to quickly ""ping"" an employee would be helpful.
3) With multiple employees sharing a space (speaking of front office employees in particular), it is difficult to get privacy. Is there a way to add a huddle room where employees can go to take a personal phone call or get on a Zoom call without distraction? Or can we figure out a way for employees to be on a Zoom call without distractions? Maybe giving everyone a ""sign"" to indicate to other employees not to bother them when their on a call? 
4) Bring back the monthly lunches!"
Better Place to Work Analysis,Very Good,I dont have any current suggestions. I am quite pleased with those I work for and with. 
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,I dont have any suggestions at this time.
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,I dont have anything at this time.  Id prefer to discuss this in person. Thank you

Culture Analysis,Improve,"I don't believe that culture is as important as employees who are compensated appropriately. Any of use could leave the team and get a job in the private sector with a 20-30% pay increase. 
 "
Morale Analysis,Very Good,"I don't have a great suggestion, because I believe the morale is positive amongst the employees I interact with most often. As stated in an earlier answer, I'm pretty happy here, otherwise I wouldn't still be here."
Reward & Recognition,Very Good,I don't have any ideas outside of the current way.

Culture Analysis,Very Good,I don't have anything at this time.  I'd prefer to discuss this in person.
Morale Analysis,Improve,i don't know it pretty low
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,"I don't know that I have a good answer here. I just think above all else it needs to feel authentic and genuine. Not just like they're being thrown a bone. When we have a luncheon and we're going through names of new people or names of people who have been promoted and the speaker is jokingly talking about how they can't pronounce a name or don't know who they are, to some people that shows this is just a check the box, etc. It has to be authentic or it's just not worth doing."
Better Place to Work Analysis,Very Good,I don't really have any suggestions. I think the Reds do a great job at taking care of the employees. I have worked at many different places and the reds are above and beyond at caring for employees.
Morale Analysis,Very Good,I don't think morale is a problem. Everyone seems happy while they are at work. I think giving staff more days to unplug will help everyone feel like they don't live here. 
Morale Analysis,Very Good,"I don't think this is an issue either.  My direct reports are good, compassionate people who I have respect for because they want to do the right things."
Culture Analysis,Very Good,I don't think this is an issue.
Morale Analysis,Very Good,"I enjoy the work and don't have any direct feedback. Ideally the team would be doing better, but the future looks bright."
Morale Analysis,Improve,I feel at times there are too many commutation streams and this leads to confusion and can disrupt morale. 
Morale Analysis,Improve/Good,"I feel great a work, I wish we have more human communication. person to person. "
Morale Analysis,Very Good,I feel Great about the work group 
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,"I feel I bring a lot to this department and organization but I haven't felt that in any meaningful way publicly. Maybe instead of birthdays or anniversaries, which are by nature just repetitive information, we could highlight a few employees and talk about what they do and what they have accomplished in their department that month, year, etc. It would give us a better idea of who we are working with and what they do to help run this organization.  

I would say making leadership aware of the importance of supporting their employees and making them feel valued and heard would be the best way to reward and recognize their staff.

Delineating rewards and attaching a monetary value weren't the best way to make people feel appreciated. "
Culture Analysis,Improve,"I feel like culture starts at the top and trickles down making it extremely hard for positive change and open communication to occur. As mentioned before, times are changing and in order to be productive, proactive, and successful you have to be more aware of what is going in the work environment. I feel like they also have to be understanding that people have personal lives/ideas/goals that we should be supporting as well.     "
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,"I feel like each department is kinda different in their culture... I feel like my department has a great culture and i'm grateful for that. Ultimately, I think that as long as it is encouraged from the top-down to NOT micro-manage and have faith and trust in your employees to do their jobs, then that will ultimately create a great culture for all. I feel like fortunately, that is not an issue in my department bc of our leadership. I do not think everyone is that lucky. For instance, I can wfh on days I need to and know that my boss trusts and supports that I WILL get my job done and not feel the need to make me feel bad about being a mom and a person with obligations outside of the workplace. I feel that not all departments have this support from their management. In return, this kind of respect makes me feel more empowered as an individual and encourages me to put that much more into the work that I provide. "
Morale Analysis,Very Good,"I feel like morale is high here. Obviously incentives and collaboration always strengthen moral, but I think we do a very good job with both. "
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,"I feel like the Reds already have a great culture. That being said, I do have a few suggestions. 1) Establish monthly or quarterly lunches with the Executive. Employees can be nominated to attend these lunches or departments can rotate. It is a great way for our leadership to get to know employees on an individual level.  2) Try to establish more consistent company-wide town halls/business updates. "
Reward & Recognition,Very Good,I feel like the Reds do a very good job recognizing milestones professionally and personally. The newsletters are great to read. 
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,"I feel like the Reds is a great place to work, and as the core of the young players begins to emerge from the farm system, it will become an even more fun/exciting place to be.  While it's nothing that can be controlled by the great majority of the front office, winning on the field improves everything.  From a practical standpoint, I feel that an understanding of what working in baseball entails at the beginning of the relationship with an employee would be helpful to making staff understand to what they're committing.  Success is not defined by how many days one can wear jeans or how many days someone can leave at Noon.  Success includes understanding how your role affects the overall positive outcome for fans and why you're an important part of it.  Working in baseball is a lifestyle choice, and knowledge of that makes for a workplace where all are on the same page."
Reward & Recognition,Very Good,I feel like we do a good job in this aspect. 
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,"I feel many times BPO hesitates to reward or bring public recognition to many of us because they are busy ""managing egos"". They are afraid of making someone mad by giving someone else a positive remark."
Culture Analysis,Very Good,I feel our culture in our department is very good and continues to improve. Continue to communicate as an organization and make all feel involved. Does not happen in most organizations. 
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,I feel that everyone here does a great job in their line of work. I feel that management and those under them aren't always on the same page as to what is important and what needs to be done in order of importance/needs.
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,I feel that I cannot really contribute to this because I am a newer employee and am not a manager or supervisor. 
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,"I feel that milestones are very recognized by the Reds. 

The Benefits statment was underwhelmining and not needed. "
Culture Analysis,Improve,"I feel that our organization needs to focus on the positive rather than the negative.  We are worn out, from the top down, with hearing all of the negatively.  This definitely impacts the culture.  People want to come to work with a purpose, the tools to do their job, constructive feedback, and a good environment.  All of the negativity since COVID  has impacted each of those employee wants.   We cannot control what is said and presented outside of the organization, but internally we can keep things positive. We have good things going on and the future is looking up. Lets spotlight that!  "
Morale Analysis,Very Good,"I feel that the morale through my eyes is high, seeing the effort that is being made to continue to improve the depth of the players on the field. And the high quality of individuals that are in charged on putting it all together."
Culture Analysis,Very Good,"I feel that the overall Culture here is good, I get along with everyone within the ballpark."
Culture Analysis,Very Good,"I feel that the Reds are involved in many exciting things in the community, and the opportunity for staff to be part of the ""cool"" things (and not just the things were volunteers are needed) is a good direction.  The introduction of the City Connect uniforms is a great example, with staff having the chance to get the gear early.  As a rule, updated apparel to wear to games and show that you're part of the employee ""family"" is always positive."
Culture Analysis,Very Good,"I feel that the Reds go above and beyond in making this an easy, comfortable and inclusive work place. In my experience here, everyone I've come in contact with has been open and helpful, I get the impression we're all pulling in the right direction. No additional suggestions."
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,"I feel that there is a strong disconnect between hourly employees and full time staff. I understand that full time benefits can not be given out freely to all, but it feels as though it can be two different work groups. I wish there was a way to bridge that gap."
Reward & Recognition,Very Good,"I feel that they do a good job with luncheons, time off at Christmas, being recognized on years of service, etc. "
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,"I feel that this program is out standing now, and dont have anything to add to improve at this time."
Culture Analysis,Very Good,I feel the baseball operations culture is good and the working environment provided exceeds expectations.
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,"I feel the Reds do a strong job in Reds Way & the anniversary recognition. Outside of that, I do not necessarily see the Reds recognizing employees in various ways. "
Culture Analysis,Very Good,I find the culture to be great
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,"I frankly could care less about an acknowledgment in a newsletter. If my work has produced a strong ROI, I would expect to be rewarded via compensation and promotions. That is currently not how the organization is set up. "
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,I have a lot in the answers below.
Reward & Recognition,Improve,"I have been with the Reds for over a year now and have never seen a single person within my department get any type of praise, recognition or reward from the Reds. Even in the cases where Reward and Recognition was warranted. In order to fix this management must take a look within and stop being so detached from the employees and the employee's jobs. Recognize hard work, the going above and beyond employees and being genuine in the idea of reward and recognition. Create a opportunity for employees to become the usher of the week, the PSO of the month and even look at doing some type of recognition for employees during the off season. "
Culture Analysis,Very Good,I have experienced a strong culture from the Reds so far.
Culture Analysis,Improve,"I have never been informed  of our culture, "
Better Place to Work Analysis,Very Good,I have no complaints
Culture Analysis,Very Good,I have no ideas right now. Reds culture I think is good currently.
Morale Analysis,Very Good,I have nothing to add to this category
Reward & Recognition,Very Good,I have nothing to add.
Morale Analysis,Improve/Good,I have nothing to add.
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,I have nothing to add.
Morale Analysis,Very Good,I have pretty good job satisfaction most of the time.  
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,"I honestly wasn't aware we had a ""Reward & Recognition"" system to begin with. So strengthening it is probably a good idea. Maybe finding a way to reward employees throughout the year for various aspects of their job? If you're not in a department with commission-based incentives, it's nearly impossible to get recognized for your performance other than a pat on the back. As I'm sure most people do, I will always work hard because that's just how I was raised and I want to do well for myself and the company, and I'm not craving consistent praise by any means for doing what I'm supposed to do. But being acknowledged when going above and beyond in some tangible way, be it monetary, tickets to something, gift cards, PTO would be appreciated. "
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,"I hope each department has department meetings where they share success stories and are able to highlight great work being done, that is important. 

We can also celebrate wins without adding negative tones: Example: ""A Reds promotion means more responsibility and the same pay"".... Lets just celebrate the promotion 
"
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,"I just feel like culture starts at the top and if I were at the top, I would at least try to introduce myself to all of my full-time employees and make some sort of personal connection. But I do know everyone has busy schedules.

Another action would be to better bridge the gap between the business side and the baseball side. I do understand the difficulties there, as well, since many of them travel and are based elsewhere. I'm not sure what it looks like at other clubs, but it would be nice to connect with them so we don't feel so much like two separate companies."
Better Place to Work Analysis,Very Good,"I just started in January and arrived in Cincinnati in late March (post-spring training), so I can't think of many suggestions with the sample size of time I have so far.  Before I give my suggestions, I want to say that everyone I work with has welcomed me with open arms and I really feel appreciated.  It's a breath of fresh from where I came from and I'm very happy and proud to be here. 

In terms of onboarding, I think it would be helpful if new hires were given a tour of the stadium and the offices.  It would help the new hires get a lay of the land. The only question is which staff member(s) will facilitate these tours.

I also think it would be nice to have more organization wide events like an ice cream social or watch party. It could help staff members from different departments get to know one another."
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,"I like how staff members have a head shot with their email.  I don't know if this already a feature.  If not, maybe we can have a contact list with all staff members email listed on exchange and next to their email is their headshot.  That would be very helpful for someone new like myself to be able to pick faces with names. "
Culture Analysis,Very Good,I like our work culture. It's a fun environment.
Reward & Recognition,Very Good,I like the current newsletter!
Culture Analysis,Very Good,I love the culture here. I have no improvements to suggest at this time.
Culture Analysis,Improve,"I need to know what our culture is as an organization to better answer this. I believe departments have their own culture, which can lead to issues as those cultures are not aligned. I think the organization as a whole lacks culture. It has goals, but no values, which I think causes the friction between departments. Departments have their own values and culture around ""how things get done"" and they conflict with one another. "
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,I never received a 5 year work ball like many have.  Other than that I have nothing at this time.
Better Place to Work Analysis,Very Good,I only have a few small suggestions. I think working for the reds is great! 
Reward & Recognition,Very Good,"I personally like this program, it brings a spark to the organization. "
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,"I suggest having a more descriptive list of what the rewards and recognition are for employees. I am not sure what each milestone year what you receive. Our monthly newsletter explains work year anniversary's but I am not sure what each employee is entitled to (i.e. 5, 10, or 20 year anniversary's)."
Morale Analysis,Improve/Good,I suggest we do little competitive games department vs department for points and then at the end of the season we can compare. top 3 departments to win get a prize of some sort. I think this could get more people active during the day and if the games are 'head-to-head' this could help people meet others from the various departments.
Morale Analysis,Improve,"I think a better communication of the organizations vision and creating trust and communicating the long term vision and ensuring that everyone from the top down trusts and believes in that vision. I think our leadership team can go speak at company events and talk about how they believe in each others groups but if that isn't communicated outside of the bally sports club in front of the whole org, then it isn't going to sell form managers to the ""boots on the ground"". "
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,I think an annual merit raise is worth consideration.  This could be on a sliding percentage scale based on employee perfomance.
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,I think culturally we have good processes in place for communication and collaboration.  Faster response times would be one area of improvement. 
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,"I think having more employee focused events to bring a sense of community, togetherness and teamwork would be very helpful. Things like a Friday Happy Hour or early dismissal after a homestand can go a long way. 

The culture used to be a real strength of this organization but now people can't wait to go home and not be at work"
Morale Analysis,Very Good,I think I have been rewarded well here in my time
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,"I think I would describe our culture as one of very hard work being done by our staff with the end goal of putting out the best product for our fans. Things may not always align - our staff's hard work doesn't necessarily always equal wins on the field that is - but our effort should be unquestioned. The hope is that the reward to all these efforts will be hosting postseason games at GABP each fall. 

I'm not sure if this falls into this bucket - but I also wish we weren't so overreactive to criticisms. We have the ability to do what's right and allow the chips to fall where they may and be able to hold our heads up high because we took the proper route, and I think in the long run we will be on the proper side of all debates. But we too often adhere to those who are divisive and not inclusive, because of xyz amount of money they spend or because they know someone. In my opinion this shows a lack of support and respect for our 'all-walks-of-life' staff. "
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,I think it goes in line with my first answer. There is a disconnect between full-time and hourly employees. This makes it difficult to feel like you are part of the team. Finding ways to strengthen these relationships would make culture better. 
Better Place to Work Analysis,Very Good,"I think it is a great place to work.
It would be nice if we could eat in the Pres club not just on Day games. Even if we had to pay, love the salad bar."
Culture Analysis,Very Good,i think it is great as it is
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,"I think listening and trying to help address issues that employees may have across ALL departments is essential to a better work place. Understanding that an MLB organization is not going to be the same as a regular company is important to help address issues/concerns that are felt by everyone. Each employee operates and works in different environments - some have a standard 9-5 and work in the office, while others work as coaches and do not have the luxury of being able to access benefits & services that are provided to those who may work with more structure. Often times it feels like questions might be asked, but rarely does it feel like something is being done to try to improve those concerns. "
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,I think more office wide events. Obviously that is hard to do but getting everyone together is nice 
Morale Analysis,Improve,"I think more schedule flexibility and work/life balance would help morale. With all the department changes, work loads, and the length of the schedule, burn out is hitting everyone extremely hard. "
Reward & Recognition,Very Good,"I think my department (Ticketing) does a really good job in this area, and that's all that matters to me."
Reward & Recognition,Very Good,I think newsletters and Reds Way are effective.
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,"I think one of the main things is PTO hours. 80 hours for a whole year is very hard to work around when other people are getting around 2-3 weeks of PTO. Being someone who does not live close to their family, I do not have enough PTO hours to visit them as much as i would through out the year. Just an example. "
Culture Analysis,Very Good,"I think our culture is strong. It is enjoyable coming to work every day, and it seems like everyone is working together towards the same goal. "
Culture Analysis,Very Good,I think our department ( scouting) has a very good culture 
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,"I think overall everything is good, but I do feel like the PTO structure should be redone. As a relatively new grad, I have several friends and acquaintances in similar roles at other companies that get 4+ weeks or unlimited PTO."
Morale Analysis,Improve,"I think overall, morale is pretty good. In our department, not all, but most people have realistic expectations. Morale does change based on interactions with other departments, as some come off more entitled than others. Ticketing act more entitled than most. The amount of shenanigans that go on in the department is laughable - happy hours, golf simulators. I'm all for team building, but it comes off as frat house. "
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,I think recognizing employees for their accomplishments and what not is fine. I don't think you need to go above and beyond for this unless you have someone retiring that has been here for quite awhile. I don't know what is given out for rewards other than jerseys so I don't have any suggestions for that.
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,"I think Reward & Recognition is difficult, compensation is always the easiest way and what will satisfy. Everyone understands that they likely made a sacrifice with compensation to work in sports, and don't need to be told how lucky they are to do that. It is a privilege to work in this organization and for a Major League Baseball team but when I'm told my Total Compensation and how lucky I am to receive benefits. I think the org could do a better job of recognizing the groups that support the greater Reds goals outside of winning and making money. I think especially in this industry, it can be very thankless work and they can maybe work with the groups that work for those two groups and see some of the natural benefits they get and feel left out. Within department, it is up to leadership to utilize things like the monthly newsletter to recognize their employees for personal and professional milestones and make people feel recognized for who they are as people. "
Better Place to Work Analysis,Very Good,"I think that every year we move in better direction, we see what works and what can be done better."
Morale Analysis,Very Good,"I think that the current opportunities for recognition are good.  I did think that the previous opportunity to send a ""cheer"" to staff who did something helpful was good."
Culture Analysis,Very Good,"I think the culture of the Reds is fine, the people who work here are great, everyone has the same objective of putting the best product on and off the field. I think everyone understands that we are here to get the job done no matter what. Sure we sometimes have to do some things that are out of place but that's just picking up our coworkers and making sure the boat stays afloat. 
It's about how well you can work with your coworkers and sure enough the people here are what make the place better."
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,I think the current system is good. The monthly newsletter was a nice addition a couple of years ago.
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,"I think the goal of this program is great and people appreciate it but the application is often not meeting that same standard. More times than not, during the announcements of anniversaries, new hires and promotions peoples names are mispronounced or the process is so rushed that it clearly shows the lack of value given to the employee. 

It is very nice of the organization to give out rewards or prizes at different meeting throughout the season but when those prizes are mocked or spoken about in a negative term while being handed out - they really lose impact

I do know a few employees who have frustration with the anniversaries because they feel that their tenure is not counted correctly because they may started as an intern or a part time employee so they do not get credit for those years. "
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,"I think the newsletter is great, potential email blasts to celebrate milestones/birthdays since the newsletter may be an afterthought to some people."

Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,"I think the Reds Rounding Third message at the end of the month is always very nice. The more acknowledgement for employees, i think the better the retention"
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,"I think the work culture as a whole is pretty strong. Both on the 1st floor and in my specific department I feel like we have a strong culture. I do however often feel disconnected from the other floors of the front office. There are more than a handful of full-time employees who I have never met/been introduced to - some of whom send me work related emails and their email is the first time I see their name/face. Need to do a better job introducing new employees. With the high turnover recently I have gone from knowing almost everyone (many beyond just name/face recognition) to knowing a much smaller amount of the employees in this building.

"
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,"I think there are different rules depending on who you are and what department you are in. For example, the second and third floor get their coffee paid for but the first floor has to pay out of their own (Craig Warman) pocket. It's unfair and I would be surprised if anyone even knows he does that. "
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,"I think there are times that this organization struggles to have a consistent message on what the goals are of the organization. I think you could look at two primary goals which are making money, just like any business, and for a baseball team, winning games and championships. There are a lot of synergies to making those happen, and some groups that are specifically dedicated to each of those things and some that are there to support both. It feels like there are times it is easy for people working on one of those goals are to scapegoat the other. At the end of the day our goals should be as our vision is ""to inspire Reds country"" and that is the beauty of working in this game is the opportunity to impact the community either directly or indirectly. At the end of the day that should be the priority and that's tough when people blame external factors for why those type of things aren't happening. (note this is where my 5 minute timer went off - making our culture better with open ended questions probably is going to take more than a 5 minute effort). How are we communicating that the financial struggles we've had make the baseball side have to find different strategies and that might cause some short term struggle. It feels like people seem to think that group is trying to make things difficult for them, as if it isn't their jobs at stake for the team to win. How are we communicating the efforts of ticket sales, corporate partnerships, and our other groups to do their best to make money in these situations. Not to mention all of the other groups like IT, ballpark ops, the community fund, and HR that don't do either of those big goals and often go completely unrecognized or limited effort is put to showing all the hard work that they do. We are a smaller front office and it should be synergetic to working toward our goals and working in our community not a place of throwing others under the bus and not saying hello to our co-workers. So I guess my suggestion would be to find more natural ways to get groups together. That also goes with scheduling those events when most groups can be there. It probably has to start with the younger/entry level people so it can start naturally. We have people that come in locally and across the country and giving them the resources to meet each other and learn the community would be great. Then it's up to our leadership to lead by example and take accountability and have a consistent message."
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,"I think these milestones need to be smaller. It seems hardly anyone sticks around for the big 10/15 year ones. Maybe if more smaller milestones or bigger/better recognition existed for 5 years (or maybe it doesn't need to be increments of 5?). Also no one cares about a glass ball or whatever trinket you get. A small bonus or maybe jersey at 5 years, etc. would be more appreciated. 
"
Reward & Recognition,Very Good,I think this is already something the Reds do very well in the newsletter and not sure what else could be done differently. 
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,"I think this question is very open given the definition. I think how defined, with how things get done in the workplace can only answer the department I am in. I can't speak for ""how things get done around the workplace"" in other departments. Personally I work across different groups within my greater department and it is a collaborative and open environment that allows for good conversation to make everyone's work better. I trust my supervisor when I have issues and trust I will get honest feedback. I think the Reds Culture could be strengthened across groups. "
Reward & Recognition,Very Good,I think we are doing good in this area. 
Culture Analysis,Improve,"I think we can take care of our current employees and work on the retention of them.  Employees want to come and work here and would really like to stay but almost all leave for better pay, benefits, work life balance, and career growth.  It is hard to create a great culture when everyone is leaving all of the time.  Also giving employees the freedom to do their job without fear of getting reemed out for a little mistake."
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,I think we do a good job now
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,I think we do a good job of recognition/celebration.
Reward & Recognition,Very Good,I think we do a great job in the Reward/Recognition area. I enjoy reading the monthly magazine/newsletter that we send out every month. 
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,I think we do have a great environment here at the office but i wish more people would stay. Sad to see so many leave this past couple of months but i guess that's just how it is.
Culture Analysis,Very Good,I think we have a quality culture as an organization. We have lots of ways to communicate with different departments and I think a lot of people display our common moto (ACR).
Culture Analysis,Improve,"I think we need to work more as a team. I feel like sometimes, departments don't want to work with other departments even though we are trying to reach the same goal. Collaborating more would lessen the amount of miscommunication that occurs and increase efficiency if we are all on the same page. I realize this not an easy issue to improve and is natural that people separate into groups and tend to stick to them. Maybe a way to improve this would be collaborative exercises-but I'm not sure what this would look like."
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,"I think we really need to be selective about activities and events we are asking staff to participate in outside of our core operating business. Far too often we asked to do work on nights and weekend outside of the normal 81-home game schedule. Offering flex-days as a return for that is not equal to the request because those flex days are normal working hours - not the nights or weekends we are losing with our friends or families. I think it is reasonable to ask staff to work a few key events such as Redsfest, a big concert or even the Redlegs Run, but putting pressure on them to attend more events or work on projects that are not specifically within the Reds scope is a poor business practice. 

I'm also disappointed in the Reds maternity and paternity leave policies. Maternity should be 12 weeks fully paid w/ the option to take 4 additional unpaid weeks. We do not offer competitive enough salaries to begin with and we are not supportive of the family structure with our current Mat policy. And I think Paternity would be more appropriate to at least be a full business week of 5 days, although perhaps a better structure would be to allow for 10 days within the first 12 weeks of birth."
Morale Analysis,Improve/Good,"I think we really, really need to eliminate the special interest projects. The things that will take chunks of our day that are not being done for the benefit of the Cincinnati Reds baseball franchise or our non-profit entities. Spending our time, resources and employees on things that involve another faction of our ownership group's business or personal interests is beyond frustrating for our staff. What we do each and every day should be Reds centered only. 

I want to say that I've heard good things about certain strides we have made through the years. The casual work wear, the parking for all full-time employees and the time off around the holidays has been very well received are were all great steps to take. "
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,"I think we should receive a gainsharing bonus at the end of each year if certain organization goals are met. We are all working towards the same goal and we should be rewarded if certain criteria are met. These could be revenue, health, etc. type goals. As more and more of the goals are met, the percent of gainsharing increases. This would be a great way to motivate employees and increase overall organizational effectiveness. 

We should always be striving to improve ourselves and it would be nice to see the organization backing that. A tuition reimbursement program would be nice. Either helping pay back school loans or funding additional education. Of course, this would need to come with a retention contract from the employee, stating that if they leave before a set number of years, the amount would need to be paid back. This would be a nice reward for employees who to commit themselves to the organization for a long-term period. 
"
Better Place to Work Analysis,Very Good,"I truly enjoy working at the Reds and am passionate for this organization. I think the continued option to be able to flex hours, as needed, since the majority of us work a lot of Reds games this takes a lot of time away from our families, friends & personal life is crucial. It is extremely important that we are allowed to flex the hours we work from the weekends/week nights to avoid any and all burn out."
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,"I was unaware of any system in existence to reward and recognize employees outside of the fantastic job that Craig Warman does with Redsway. Often, anniversaries and birthdays are forgotten about, promotions are joked about, and “free” zoo tickets are considered in our overall compensation. Although TinyPulse had its flaws, I loved how we could give our colleagues shout outs and praise on a public board. Is there a way we could bring something like this back? Events like the Bats game, Kings Island Day/Zoo Day, etc. are very much appreciated & should continue as well. "
Morale Analysis,Improve,I wish that there was more uniformity in our standards for employees. I understand that circumstantial situations will arise. It would just be nice to see some sort of set standard.

Morale Analysis,Improve/Good,I'm a firm believer that compensation directly influences morale. 
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,"I'm a little confused with the Reward & Recognition system.  I would have to say that I have never worked somewhere that has placed the importance on employees for the way we treat out customers (Reds Way).  I have heard so many times that the way we treat our customers is amazing.  I wouldn't say this is the case for how people treat their peers.  I do appreciate the Christmas gift, but if there are ever opportunities for off site events, it is difficult to attend.  "
Culture Analysis,Improve,"I'm not sure if this is directly related to the culture, however it impacts on how we get things done......communication.
 There is a interdepartmental communication disconnect that impacts the employee and customer experience.  There are  many moving parts between HOF, ticketing, corporate sales, creative services, HR, and BPO that can put an employee behind the 8 ball when speaking with a customer. Most of the information can be found by searching reds.com or the portal, however it can be time consuming and frustrating for the employee and our customer.

In my past career, our employer would have a daily operations briefing page on the company portal that would give a high level view of current events.  We could create a similar page that will highlight:
HOF- current exhibit, special offers, special event
Ticketing/Kids Club - current ticket offers (specific to the next homestand)
      Game Day - Tuesday 3-2-1, military discount, 
Corporate Sales - Larosa's, Chick -fil-A, and pertinent information
Special Event - today's events
BPO - weather update, gate times, attendance projection, gate giveaway, projects
HR - current initiatives (benefit enrollment, heath fair, etc.)

Most of the information I listed can be found in various documents and as previously stated, however it is time consuming to find the information. 
Zach's homestand calendar is a great example of sharing information that is pertinent to a game day.  Expanding this format globally would greatly benefit the entire organization. "
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,"I'm not sure to what extent we acknowledge work anniversaries with larger in-person gatherings, but (assuming we don't) those would go a lot further than electronic newsletters."
Morale Analysis,Improve,"I'm very proud of working for the Reds.  I especially appreciate the game tickets we receive.  I was a little disappointed in the Yankee series that we receive two tickets, not 4.  I understand that will be a sellout, but it is an opportunity missed to appreciate the employees on such a big weekend.  I was going to go but since there were just two tickets, I ended up giving them to my 2 guests to whom I promised the tickets and I will bow out of going. 
I know and value all of the many things I receive working for the Reds.  Insurance, Tickets, small gifts, and other things.  I know what they are and greatly appreciate it.  I know the “Corporate Culture” and corporations all have their benefits and perks for employees.  I was taken aback when I received the ""Rewards"" sheet in the mail.  I would think that is a sheet that you would give a prospective or new employee, not the current employees.  I can probably take the sheet to other corporations and get the same things if not more, with the exception of the game tickets.  The sheet made me feel unappreciated.

Would like to see us get to a place where all full time employees can be trusted with sensitive information and feel in the loop about current events from both the business and baseball side of the organization.

It is difficult to receive pay increases. This has effected and will continue to effect turnover. Need to improve reward system. Pay increases should increase with responsibility. Many employees have been forced to undertake additional work caused by high turnover. The increased workload and responsibility should not be expected unless partnered with pay increases.

Culture Analysis,Improve,"In a team oriented organization you are only as strong as your weakest link. Unfortunately, there are examples of poor behavior, bad values and allowed bad behavior when it comes to what employees are asked to do as part of their jobs. The management has allowed bad employees to hold certain departments captive through their refusal to hold the bad employees accountable to the same standards as everyone else. In order to fix this particular culture, management must hold everyone to the same standards. If an employee is unwilling to do parts of the job or is found to be in violation of policies and refuses to come up to the Reds standard then that employee should be dealt with."

Culture Analysis,Very Good,In my department things get done also there is plenty to to 
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,"In my experience, this is a good place to work. I am pretty happy here, otherwise I wouldn't still be here. One area that I think could improve is our vacation/PTO allotment. I often hear employees discussing their PTO allotment with a scarcity mindset, and it's disappointing that they have to do that. Time out of the office is important for keeping employees engaged and enthused about their time in the office. Phil is the first to always thank staff and their families for the time sacrifices made during the season, and an easy way to reward that would be by giving employees more time off to use as they see fit. The last team I worked for had an unlimited PTO policy. I am not asking for The Reds to copy that, but I do feel that employees who have been here less than 15 years don't have enough PTO. 

I want to be clear that I am not referring to ""flex time"" (i.e. time out of office in the same week as home games to try and balance out the amount of total hours spent at the ballpark), but actual PTO that employees can use when they need, with approval, without having to provide justification. Flex time is important too, but separate from the feedback that I am giving in this response."
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,"In my opinion, culture should include character.  This could include what makes the Cincinnati Reds different from other organizations?  What are our pillars (core values) that define us as an organization? "

Morale Analysis,Improve,It goes back and forth. Some days we are allowed to do our work and teach the kids about life and baseball. Other times its full of second guessing and questioning 
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,"It is important we bring back events we used to do prior to Covid. For example, Kings Island & the Louisville Bats games are important to our culture. I enjoy getting our entire organization together as often as possible. "
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,"It is my opinion the Reds do a good job of making our office a good place to work.  The atmosphere is friendly and generally, and for the most part the facility is a comfortable environment with a few exceptions.  
The results of COVID presented opportunities for employers to evaluate the work-life balance for their employees. It also presented challenges for employers as competition for good talent increased across many industries.  
Suggestions:
1. From a facility perspective the office could be cleaner.  Employees are not held accountable for keeping their work areas neat. There are times the hallways and work areas are littered with boxes, hand carts, and other items.  It seems like people assume someone will clean up behind them. Coming into a clean and organized office can set a positive mood for the workday.
2.  A flexible work schedule is and will always be an important topic of discussion for the majority of our employees.  I believe the Reds view of flexible work schedules having to be universal for all is not the correct approach. It is my opinion that guidelines should be established based on the needs of the position.  I know of no major company where work schedules are universal across all departments. With the Reds, there are essential positions that require an employee to be present in the office each day.  There are other departments that can allow flexibility to have a hybrid schedule to work from home or office.  I feel the Reds need to establish parameters for hybrid schedules based on the demands of the job.  Personally, I prefer to work in the office, I am not a work from home person.  However, when situations arise where working from home would be beneficial, it would be nice to have the flexibility.  
The hybrid model would be managed by each department. Employees would have the option to work from home based on the needs of the department and would have limitations to the number of occurrences. Each director will be responsible to ensure proper staffing in the office.

Additionally, I would like to see the Reds establish in-season and off-season operating hours.  In-season 8:30-5:30.  Off-season 8:00-5:00.  The off-season hours of operation would run from November 1 - February 28/29.  

"
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,It is very stressful with less staff and more work as Reds employees leave.  It seems a lot of old positions are spread out among the employees left when it feels we can already barely keep up with the current workload.  This is an environment where Im afraid to make a mistake.
Morale Analysis,Improve/Good,"It may seem odd, but I think doing some simple things could increase morale. For example, allowing employees to work outside on occasion. Getting a little sunshine would be great for morale! What about having an employee family event on the field at the end of the season? Not everyone plays softball :) What about ""bring your kid to work day/job shadow day""? Other Clubs host events like this."
Morale Analysis,Improve,"It would be nice to see more of a focus on ""work life balance."" Working a majority of the games throughout the season can get strenuous, and it would be nice to have the autonomy to work in a more flexible schedule, or obtain more floating vacation days depending on how many games and weekends worked. 

There are a lot of great parts of working for the Reds. However, the biggest frustration is the lack of compensation. I'm sure there are multiple other entries saying the same thing. It's quite frustrating at times that this organization makes earning an increase in pay so difficult. Most companies have an annual % increase in pay to reward employees for their hard work and loyalty to the organization. Year after year after proving your worth, asking for a raise is like pulling teeth. It feels like sometimes this organization would rather pay much lower than market standards to their staff until they are essentially forced to leave the Reds to find work that pays what they are worth. Over the last decade, we have seen numerous people of high value leave because the Reds will not properly compensate what staff is worth. Rather than reward employees for their hard work and company loyalty, it feels as if the Reds are so quick to let someone go and hire a younger, less qualified candidate to do similar work for far less pay. 

I truly believe this a special place to work, and am confident most people feel the same way. It's truly sad that this organization has not been willing to increase compensation, but mask it with title changes with no additional pay. I fear this will lead to many others leaving the Reds in the coming years if this is not revamped. We want to stay here!! Please just be willing to pay us what we are worth.  "
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,It would be really helpful for many in baseball ops if there was a 'working suite' for employees below a director title weekday games (when one is available) as there was in 2022. This would help increase productivity while still enjoying the game!

Morale Analysis,Improve,"It's hard for me to feel 100% engaged every day for 8+ hours a day, 40+ hours a week. Sometimes I feel like my morale or my team's morale is low. Maybe having at least one day a week we could work from home would help because I've noticed that when I'm able to work one day from home during the week I feel more mentally and physically rested which in turn makes me feel more ready to take on the next day. Another thing we could do is allow us some time to take a class or dedicate some time for us to learn a skill that would help us improve in some way. I feel like it would benefit us and the Reds because it would give us a break from our every day routine and would make us better at our jobs."

Morale Analysis,Improve,"It's no secret that working in baseball/sports can be draining. That's part of what you sign up for, and I get that. But if the pay isn't going to match that work, then having some additional benefits would be nice. Not to mention that it's frankly even more cumbersome when the team isn't performing (which has been the case for 10 years now). That absolutely affects morale (and pay) and trickles down to employees. Things like a couple designed WFH days allowed per month, early dismissal on Fridays when the team is gone, etc. could go a long way. Not all departments can leave for happy hour after every day game or get full days off after homestands, so finding something works universally would be a big step."

Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve,"Leadership. We need signals of direction (here is where we are, and here is where we want to go). What are we aiming for in baseball, business, and the community? What are we trying to do? Otherwise were just going through the motions. 

This requires significant transparency and visibility from senior leadership. We need to see them more often. We need to hear from them much more often (and not just about how baseballs economics are “stacked against us” in a “small market”). Be willing to admit when/where things went wrong; dont just blame the system.

Below the leadership level, I think we can create a better workplace by maximizing interactions/collisions (see Culture section), providing breakfast/lunch opportunities (“we all need to eat” plus it maximizes interaction), and generally being better at reward & rec (like being a lot better at promoting). "
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,Less meeting
Morale Analysis,Improve/Good,Let people work from home a day or two a week. We have so many meetings on zoom but are still required to do them from our desk. Saving people time commuting and reducing their gas and childcare expenses would make a big difference in how they feel about their jobs.
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve,"Let the people do their jobs, I know this place involves collaborating but sometimes there are too many cooks in the kitchen that don't need to be.

COMMUNICATION!! One of the hardest parts of working in this place is the communication within departments and throughout the organization. It is unbelievable how there are things kept in secret from a person that needs to know, especially when the job could be done easier. Instead they are finding out from another person or are finding out at the last minute and has to work at the last minute. People within the organization need to be open with their coworkers in order to have a better balance at work. 

It is very difficult for those people who don't have to work 9 to 5 to attend group outings or extracurricular activities outside of work, and when there are off days during the season, those are truly necessary for those who work games, not just home games, to take the days off.  Sure, there are times when work calls for you at late hours of night, however, people need to be mindful of people's time away from work. "
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,"Let's start with paying employees what their overall value is to the Organization. Reward great work (ie exceeding goals) with yearly salary raises (not one every 3-5 years).  We should receive a bump in salary that keeps up with annual cost of living/inflation increases. Maybe that would help with long-tenured people looking to leave the Organization.  Those that remain/stay long term should be rewarded for their loyalty.

The Total Rewards statement I received made me laugh, as it made me want to look for a higher paying job. I know it was intended to enhance employee engagement, but its impact was exactly the opposite.

Also, please stop joking that when people get promoted that they are going to get paid the same for doing more work. 

Other than the above, maybe offer choices for rewards instead of after 5 years you get this, or after 10, 20+ you get that.

Monthly newsletters are cool. Reds Way is fine. Customized jerseys for long-tenured employees are cool, but doubtful very many people will end up getting there in the future..."
Morale Analysis,Improve,"Limit turnover, those that stay end being over worked and overwhelmed. 

Leaders have a huge responsibility when it comes to morale. How leaders make people feel will have the largest impact on morale. What are we doing to teach/improve this at the sr. leadership level? How do do the Sr. Level leaders at this organization make people feel? "
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,"Listening and paying attention to the employees. Not even just in terms of these surveys, but really just being aware and reading the room throughout the year. It's pretty obvious when morale is low around here or everyone is being overworked, so recognizing that and addressing it in some way at times should be a priority rather than just piling on more work on moving on to the next ""big"" thing that we'll overthink and overspend on."
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,"Look at all the issues of the reds newsletters, there has never been any recognition of any of the people who live in the tunnel."
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,Loving the new rewards system and that it has lasted. So many times we push these to the side for the sake of getting work done and glad to see they have made it this far.
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,Maintain good work-life balance. Best benefit to working for this organization.
Morale Analysis,Improve/Good,Make baseball people feel like their voice has as much rank as the analytical people. Baseball experience is so valuable. 
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,make employees aware of when they are doing a good as well as bad job
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,"Make the job itself rewarding, then rewards and recognition are simply redundant. "
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,Make these more prominent - I did not even know they existed
Morale Analysis,Improve,Make us feel respected in our positions
Morale Analysis,Improve,"Managers need to encourage and support employees independently, while building a team model of excellence. "
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,Maybe a few more meetings.
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,Maybe a monthly lunch (ball park fare-during season) Organization update.
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,"maybe and employee spotlight? second and third shift particularly in command center aren't included in most lunches or early afternoon events. Most events seem to take place around 11-1 and report time for command center second shift isn't until 2 pm.
Third shift doesn't leave until 7 am maybe a morning coffee and donut social would include them. "
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,"Maybe more ""daily challenges"" to create some sort of excitement each day of work. Whether it is a work related challenge or non-work related personal challenge."
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,Maybe more cross department education and interaction. The more we understand the more we appreciate.
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,Maybe more rally events to pump up the staff.
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,Maybe recognize some of the full time people on the field like you do with part time people. Not my thing but I think it is for a lot the personal. That way they can be recognized before family and friends.
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,Maybe sharing wins or positive outcomes for the many initiatives just to inform staff of what is working and maybe even what isn't.
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,Maybe there could be more initiatives in place that make us want to work harder in order to get some reward in return. I thought the two days off that were offered to us for working Redsfest (even though I was required to work it) is an example of an initiative that I felt was particularly successful.
Morale Analysis,Very Good,"Me siento agusto con el compartamiento de todos mis companeros del equipo (""I feel comfortable with the behavior of all my colleagues on the team."")"
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,"Mejorar las condiciones salariales en general. Se debe premiar el esfuerzo de aquellos trabajadores que trabajan dando el 100% cada día. Ejemplo reconocimiento público de dicho empleado. Puede ser el empleado del mes, etc."
Morale Analysis,Very Good,ML baseball is a difficult and tough business and as a scout so much of our morale being upbeat comes from success on the field. Our day to day involvement in the business end is very limited and as such we depend on the scoreboard to gauge how its going. My working environment is great and morale would be greater bringing a Championship to Cincinnati…
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,Monthly employee recognition from each department. 
Morale Analysis,Improve/Good,"Monthly or quarterly ""temperature checks"" with surveys like this. 

More frequent appreciation/wellness/mental health break events like Stretch Lab, Coffee/Smoothie bar, etc. "
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,Monthly recognition in-department 
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,Monthly reviews from supervisor on progress 
Morale Analysis,Very Good,Morale has been high since joining the Reds.
Morale Analysis,Improve,"Morale in our corner of the organization is very low. For example, we knew nothing of the opportunity to go to the  Field of dreams until we heard others in the company talking about it. "
Morale Analysis,Improve,Morale in the workplace could be strengthened by rewarding employees with incremental pay increases as opposed to large jumps after longer periods of time.
Morale Analysis,Improve/Good,"Morale is created by leaders who sincerely care about their employees..Anything that you do to strengthen their working environment and benefits of being A Red, should increase morale "
Culture Analysis,Very Good,Morale is great
Morale Analysis,Very Good,Morale is high
Morale Analysis,Very Good,"Morale is high in our department, and our attitude towards others within our department is very good. We pull for each other. "
Morale Analysis,Improve/Good,"Morale is pretty good from my perspective.  That increases when people feel valued, feel appreciated, and recognized for their contribution to a greater picture.  This is influenced by the type of people hired and employed.  So increasing morale begins with the hiring process."
Morale Analysis,Very Good,Morale is very good
Morale Analysis,Very Good,Morale starts at the top and the Reds seem to be excelling in this area.  The top leadership could always get out more especially during games.
Morale Analysis,Very Good,"Morale to me is how you view your own mental well-being at work.  Personally, things have been great for me here over the last couple years which is really why a continued focus on work/life balance and having a flexible work lifestyle in an industry that can be very time demanding in the summertime is important. 

Working in baseball often requires us to be pulled from our family's during nights, weekends and summer holidays so all I ask is that we continue to make the effort to recognize those small sacrifices and allow for flexibility when possible.  "
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,"More ""events"" mixing departments to get to know other people in other roles."
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,"More activities like we used to have...steaks at grail, bats games for example"
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,"More collaboration with other departments within the organization (Ticketing, Marketing, Social Media, etc.) and opportunities to get to know those departments "
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,More collaborative events between the business and baseball sides
Morale Analysis,Improve/Good,"More communication & showing care for people's lives is usually the best way to improve morale besides the obvious answer of more resources into winning and increasing wages to reflect higher inflation & costs of living. An emphasis, especially during the off-season to bring employees together and going back to the zoom calls and efforts from 2020 would be a huge morale boost. In particular, when our General Manager has been sending out personal holiday cards during the off-season, that is a small example of making us feel important and cared about. "
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,More competitive compensation and benefits package 
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve,"More competitive pay and benefits. There are a lot of valuable perks, but total compensation is still well below industry standards. We can ride the prestige of being a major league baseball team further than most industries, but at some point just getting the best talent requires ignoring the ""baseball discount"" as anything more than a tiebreaker - we should be offering salaries and packages that are equivalent to other industries and getting the best by being a more interesting place to work than GE or a bank. Especially with investment in the major league team declining, there should be a significant amount of resources to re-allocate to much more efficient spending - if we're not spending $5 million for a middle reliever, where does that money go?"
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,More competitive pay.  We sacrifice financially for loving the job and environment.
Morale Analysis,Improve/Good,More connection between Arizona baseball operations staff and Cincinnati baseball operations staff.
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,"More consistent organizational meetings with the entire staff so that employees can get to know one another better, share ideas and learn best ways to communicate with one another."
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,"More cross-departmental interaction. There are clear divides between some departments here that do not need to exist if we just took the time to address them and make sure everyone in the Org (at least everyone in Cincinnati) meets/knows each other and what we do.  However, as stated in my previous answer, our lack of a willingness to staff to the degree we need to is a hurdle for us here, as certain departments just absolutely do not have the requisite time to participate in such events/activities.

Ran out of time in my 5 minutes to list any further ideas. Encourage us to have more targeted questions on the next iteration of this. Will likely help response rates."
Morale Analysis,Improve/Good,"'-More employee events - even smaller scale department events. Especially during the high of the season when burnout occurs. 
-Random afternoons off after long homestands
-All-Star Break Holiday. A lot of teams shut the front office down during the week of the All-Star game. "

Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,More individual awards.
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,More information from leadership team on direction of business and baseball ops 
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,more input from the employees to management
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,More integration with other departments would be the only thing I could think of. Getting to see what everyone does day in and day out.
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,More intentional efforts to blend the different departments.  There are precious few opportunities to be together and staffs typically don't mix with others during larger group meetings and functions.
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,More interaction between different departments.
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,"More involvement in employee decision making, more uniformity in rules. "
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,"'-more leadership recognition outside of just tenure status

Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,More management training for the younger leaders as they're taking on more roles as the more experience move on.
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,More monetary rewards. 
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,More off days in Arizona. We work 6 or 7 days a week for 11 months. 
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,More opportunities to gather outside of work when the team is home vs on the road.
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,More opportunities to serve our community together. There is a lot of research out there on the many levels of benefits that come from volunteering. I also think more options for mentorship would be helpful...maybe with someone you wouldn't necessarily work with. Maybe something you can sign up for if you would like to participate and then you get matched with someone. 
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,More options of gift cards not all are fans of Larosa's or Skyline.
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,"More recognition throughout the entire department for employees who exceed expectations

Morale Analysis,Improve/Good,More Reds sponsored staff outings to boost morale  
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,"More Redsway, offer up good seats to employees for doing a good job, ie not missing a game, always being positive."
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,More resources  upgrading work space 
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,More team building exercises or team building outings. 
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,"More team events like the lunch & learn that HR had for the Boys of Summer. More events for female staff. More days for maternity & paternity leave. Summer Fridays off, some other teams do this. Reds employee fun Olympics. This would include fun competitive games like corn hole, pickleball, dodgeball, etc.   "
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,"More time for outside activities and conversations to get to know coworkers beyond their abilities at work-related tasks. Off-premise gatherings, yet still local for convenience, cost-effectiveness and accessibility - being more adventurous and creative than getting a drink across the street (visiting a museum, fowling, escape rooms, hike in a park, softball, kickball, etc, etc). Could also be events/roundtable discussions at the office."
Morale Analysis,Improve/Good,More time off
Culture Analysis,Improve,"More transparency and better communication. And that starts from the top. It's hard to get behind and believe in what we're doing if we don't really know what we're doing. We also went from hearing from someone at the top consistently to not hearing from that person at all. Certain events probably led to this being an intentional decision of sorts, which I definitely understand publicly, but going radio silent to your own company after 15 years of the opposite doesn't send the best message. Also, let people do what they've been hired and are supposedly empowered to do. The overmanaging or instilled fear of making a mistake does not allow people to be their best professional self and creates a culture that no one benefits from."
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,"More WFH opportunities. Half days when the team is out of town on a Friday or before a holiday weekend. That used to happen in years past we would get an email saying thanks for your work on a long homestand, etc. "
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,More work from home options for front office departments
Morale Analysis,Improve/Good,More work space. Suite to watch the game and work during day games.
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,More work space. The space I work in is an area fit for maybe 3 people and we stack 6 people in there.
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve,"More work/life balance and flexibility, better vacation time, or something similar. The corporate world is changing and evolving with the times, but we are not. The 40 hour work week is slowly disappearing. Some day's you have 16 hours of work that need to be done, and others you may have only 4 especially with our schedule. If your work is getting done in a timely fashion, yet you're hourly, you're still required to sit in the office and stare at your computer to hit 40 hours. Also, better pay is huge. Many full-time staff have to work second jobs and/or live paycheck to paycheck. It is not sustainable lifestyle, and that is why so many incredible and irreplaceable employees have left. "
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,"More younger, diverse voices amongst the leadership.  More autonomy for mid-level decisions as opposed to everything funneling through a few individuals."
Morale Analysis,Improve/Good,"My idea to strengthen morale is a better attitude as employees. Our ball club is not the best ball club in the MLB but I've taken so much pride in working for this team because not everyone gets to wake up and say they work here. Having better attitude as employees should be a strength that everyone carries, no matter the outcome. I believe it would help strengthen the morale at the Cincinnati Reds. "
Morale Analysis,Very Good,"My job satisfaction is high. But if you support those that work for you, they will support you."
Morale Analysis,Improve/Good,My morale is good. More time off would strengthen my morale.
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,"My only recommendation is to offer better incentives for Reds Way rewards, outside of Skyline, Larosa's, etc. I think everyone would appreciate a better selection including Amazon, Kroger, local restaurant gift cards, etc. "
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,"My suggestion would be to add more staff to BPO Maintenance so we could distribute the workload more evenly and allow for more room to let people take vacations on a more flexible schedule. There are many times through out the year where dates are ""blacked out""."

Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,Occasionally use an unsold suite or group areas as a perk to recognize departments or staff members.
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve,"Of course, better pay, better benefits is always what employees want.     I want to walk in the door and feel appreciated for the work I have done.   I want to be listened to and not shunned/dismissed when presenting for my concerns/viewpoints on topics, procedures and policies.  I take pride in my work and I want those around me to value, respect and appreciate that.  

Respect and appreciate me and I will give you all I got!"

Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,Offer work from home once or twice a week; much more productive.
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,On Anniversaries/Birthdays - offer half days or a vacation day for certain milestones. Or something that has more meaning. 
Morale Analysis,Very Good,On Scouting our morale is high and look forward to going finding players
Morale Analysis,Improve/Good,"One area that may strengthen employee morale is understanding someone else's job.  My morale is strong as I truly enjoy my job and coming to work each day.  As I thought about the question of strengthening morale I realized that my morale is not just based on the outlook I have in regard to my job, it is also based on my understanding of the roles of other employees in departments outside of mine.  
My position gives me the opportunity to understand processes in other departments.  I have shadowed with employees to better understand their responsibilities, and how my actions may impact their job.  As I learn about their roles, I have improved the way I do things as my actions impact other departments.

Example, I was unaware of the process and time invested by Creative Services to complete a work order.  It may be a small request on my part, however I did not take into account the number of work orders they had and how long it takes to complete a request until I spent time to understand their processes. 
Not only did this open my eyes and appreciate this group more, I believe their morale improved by the appreciation that I expressed in the work they do. Simple understanding and appreciation of another person's role can increase morale for myself and others."
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,"One of the best rewards ever, was to close the offices between Christmas and New Year. This is super beneficial and very appreciated. 

Another wonderful reward is paying for employee parking. This is super wonderful and so appreciated. Parking is expensive and it can be dangerous walking to my car alone, far away at night after working until the game is over. 

I would love to know more about the wonderful successes in other departments. For example: When another department hit their goal. When they implemented a new process or ballpark feature. When they launched a new initiative that went well. "
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,"One of the most important things we can do as an organization would be to plan in advance with intention. Not doing so can be apparent to other employees as well as fans or vendors who we interact with; not a good look.
 
When employees have too many responsibilities, it leads to burnout and fatigue, not characteristics we want to share with our fans. I feel that in my own experience, and I see it in fellow co-workers."
Culture Analysis,Very Good,One of the things I think is very special about the Reds is the desire to make the culture a priority. Keep moving in that direction. 
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,One thing I would suggest is follow through with words of appreciation.  We tend to forget some of the most important people.  
Morale Analysis,Improve/Good,open dialog between management and employees is a fundamental importance.
Morale Analysis,Improve/Good,Opportunity creates morale when an employee feels he or she has a chance grow in the company based on performance. 
Morale Analysis,Improve/Good,Organize team building activities. Implement a health and wellness program.
Morale Analysis,Very Good,"Other than being tired at the end of a homestand, I am happy while doing my work. Everyone in the box office has a great attitude and we work very well together. "
Morale Analysis,Improve,"Other then our immediate supervisor, It would be nice to occasionally hear from other front office officials. Many people talk about the importance of having open dialogue. Few are good at actually following through. "
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,"Our benefits and company perks are outstanding.  MLB Pension, 401K, Health Benefits, comp tickets, company outings etc…  all excellent.

A few suggestions:
1.	More family activities on the field or at the ballpark
2.	Ability for employees children to participate in pre/in-game or on-field activities/promotions
3.	Provide more customized offerings for milestone anniversaries.  
a.	What are things that truly mean the most each individual?  Something they wouldnt otherwise buy?  
i.	What about some type of experience?  Corporate/ticket sales spring training trip, or fly-a-way trips.  
ii.	Opportunity to go watch the Reds play on the road.  Possibly provide travel or hotel credit.
"
Culture Analysis,Improve,"Our culture is mostly fine. We have some departments that are disconnected from within. We don't have alignment the way we describe it. We have certain people who are not professional, but they have gotten away with it for years. 
We talk about creating a winning culture in the minor leagues, but we eliminate competition. We have to win, but we also have to play ""priority"" players. We have several non-priority players who are just as good or better than priority players, but we are supposed to win with the lesser players. What if we actually created competition and we forced the ""priority players"" to earn their playing time? Instead of rolling out the red carpet for them to walk their way to the big leagues and forced them to earn it we would raise the floor of the organization and find good players who weren't drafted in the top five rounds. If the priority player earns his way to the top then they have learned how to compete and won't shy away from adversity and we could create a competitive winning culture instead of just having filler players surrounding the priority players who are going to get more opportunities to fail and get away with less professional on-field behavior. 
We have too many coaches in the system who are not pulling in the same direction. Too many coaches who are in it for themselves and not the players. We don't pay exceptionally well so good coaches are always on the hunt for the next opportunity. The Reds are loyal to their people, which is great, but those people fall into the trap of complacency and aren't making an effort to learn and adapt with the game. Can't help but think politics plays a role in this. "
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,"Our culture is strong given the resources provided specifically in the department. All employees are willing to lend a helping hand and step in beyond their job duties. 

The front office however is very siloed. Each department works very independent of each other. When asking for support from individuals outside of departments, it usually is met with a lot of pushback and unwillingness. "
Culture Analysis,Very Good,Our culture is strong. 
Culture Analysis,Improve,"Our culture of fear is demotivating. Employees feel anxious and frequently worry about unwanted consequences if they make a mistake. Everyone is doing their best to do a great job for the organization. If someone makes a mistake, they don't need to be demoralized or yelled at....we can help them and coach them through the issue so it is better next time.

Encourage feedback. It will take a while, but we don't ask/give feedback on a regular basis. We've never been given an opportunity to share feedback regarding our manager or executive leadership."
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,"Our culture should be defined by all personnel. High expectations and standards are great, but accountability is the key. Being accountable and held accountable to the values and standards. "
Better Place to Work Analysis,Very Good,Our current PD Leadership is doing a tremendous job supporting us in achieving our goals. In knowing that they are supporting us and valuing us goes a long way.
Morale Analysis,Very Good,Our department morale is great.
Morale Analysis,Improve,"Our executive leadership lacks diversity. The decisions made at the top trickle down and effect women and minorities negatively. Our fans our diverse, our community is diverse - if we want to serve our fans, we need to lift up and consider diverse perspectives...which are not well represented in our executive leadership team.  
 
New staff do not get PTO until they've worked here for 6 months, please change that. Please have PTO effective immediately. Managers have to approve PTO anyway. 

Give Reds employees a discount at concessions, at least 40-50% 

Please close the office at 5PM"
Morale Analysis,Improve/Good,"Our Morale could improve if everyone was on the same schedule. When you have some working their own schedule, and it requires others to work more hours or have less weekends off, I feel it brings down morale."
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,Our staff does a good job of rewarding and recognizing each other in our team meetings. I didn't know the Reds had an official rewards and recognition program.  
Morale Analysis,Improve,"out of our control, but a winning culture would help immensely. team performance and PR snafus feels like a cloud over our heads and a losing mentality."
Better Place to Work Analysis,Very Good,Over all I believe the Reds has an amazing work environment but especially in my own department. Ive had opportunities to leave but whats keeping me here is my work family in my department.
Culture Analysis,Improve,"Overall I think we have a great culture. I think people get burnt out on a lot of last minute fire drills. As an organization, we often wait until the last minute to plan events, order gifts or recognize hard work. Having to hurry up and put something together often comes off as rushed and cheap. No reason for a lot of the last minute changes or planning IMO. When you fail to plan, you plan to fail. "
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,Overall organization does good job with this
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,"Overall the Reds are a good place to work when you are reporting to a good leader. There are many people within the organization that have made this job their career and spent 10+ years here. That would not happen if this wasn't a good place to work.

How do we make it better? Put better leaders in place who care about others personal growth and career growth, work on themselves to improve to be better leaders, ask for feedback and empower the really good talent we have to make decisions (Starting with the highest levels of leadership, SVP).  

Most of the time people do not leave jobs, they leave bad leaders. We always celebrate someone leaving like it is so great for them but many of them did not want to leave. They left because they are in a toxic environment with their manager, which in a lot of cases is a trickle down from Sr. leadership in this organization who can be very difficult to work for. 

"
Better Place to Work Analysis,Very Good,"Overall, I enjoy the work environment we have.  I am sure there will be a number of things that are brought up...some valid, and probably some not so.  I absolutely continue to believe this is a great place to work, and would only say the continuation of flexible work schedules would be something I would like to see.  Work Life Balance is something that is extremely important to me.  "
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,"Overall, I find the organization a good place to work. I feel that there are plenty of people that like to question how certain jobs are done or get involved in things that do not need to involve them. I think if people stayed in their lane more often or didn't give their unnecessary two cents, it would make it a bit less stressful. "
Better Place to Work Analysis,Very Good,"Overall, there is not a whole lot that I believe needs to be changed necessarily."
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,Pay is low
Morale Analysis,Improve,Pay more to compete with other jobs in the area. I think every person (non exec) who works at the Reds could leave to work somewhere else and make much more money. We love our jobs and love what we do so we stay. But I don't feel like we are rewarded for staying. New hires get hired on making as much or sometimes more as tenured employees with better benefits. It's not sending a very good message to employees who have been here for years when the new hire makes as much money as you do.
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,"pay raises and bonuses would go a long way to motivate. jerseys and gift cards are nice, but money talks."
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,Pay what the person deserves.
Morale Analysis,Improve,"Pay your workers a competitive wage. When giving end of year raises and you say its 4% across the board just know those at the bottom don't think its fair. When someone is making over $80k a year versus someone making $40k a year all it does is make the rich richer. With that, explain how a 4% raise helps when inflation was over 7%."
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,"People don't care about meaningless awards or having their name in a newsletter, give them something tangible. Had a baby? Parental leave. Anniversary? PTO day. Personally, I actively do not want to be recognized publicly, but I do want value returned if I perform well. Year-end bonuses would be a good way to accomplish that. On a smaller scale, give out Bally Sports Club or Diamond Club tickets. Give someone a suite if they go way above and beyond. Perhaps some people would want public recognition, and that would be determined by their supervisors. Give people things they personally value, not just things executives think are important, especially at lower levels of compensation where financial rewards are much more significant than things that don't affect their lives."
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,Periodic work from home opportunities.

Better Place to Work Analysis,Very Good,"Personally, I have not been in this industry long enough to be able to give any type of constructive criticism. I believe, so far that the Cincinnati Reds are an adequate organization to work for. "
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,"Personally, recognition from peers and management stands out much more to me than the newsletter (which sometimes slips through in my inbox). So perhaps a greater emphasis on personal recognition -- whether public or private -- would be more impactful for me."
Morale Analysis,Improve,"Physical and Verbal recognition by department heads. Working long weekends, should be followed by an extra day off. Increased responsibility should always be followed by a pay increase. Burnout is affecting the entire organization. 

When I am at work I often feel taken advantage of. Work loads continue to increase but pay and benefits stay stagnant. I have had to take up additional jobs to continue to make ends meet during the recession. This makes it hard to maintain a work life balance and focus on protecting mental health. 
"
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,"Please allow a few days to work from home to those who can (and game day employees during the off season). This is something 99% of employees want, we just need leadership to get behind this. Please consider this. 

Have more space for meetings. When the board room and 1b are booked there is no place to go. Most of us don't have a private office so we need to find a space somewhere else in the building.

The cafeteria area could be improved. It doesn't seem clean and needs updating. More vending machines would be nice for days when food isn't served.  "
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,"Please give employees a discount at GABP concession stands. We could scan our badge at checkout to prove and track redemptions. 

Please close the office at 5:00pm. The extra 30 minutes makes it super difficult for working parents. Daycare closes at 6:00, youth sports begin at 6/6:30, workout classes begin at 6pm,...we can't make it in time. If we need to leave work early, we have to ask permission and are made to feel guilty for leaving before 5:30. 

Please allow PTO for new employees to be effective immediately - Why do you make them wait 6 months before their PTO begins? 

Please allow staff that works games to have off on Fridays in the summer, when the team is away. Especially, staff that doesn't clock in/out. Managers are forced to use PTO if they want to take off or leave early, even after working overtime (but it isn't tracked or compensated for, because they don't clock in/out) "
Better Place to Work Analysis,Very Good,"Please Please Please close the office at 5PM. 

The Reds do a lot of things very well, this is a great place to work. However, there is always room for improvement..."
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,Please see above answer. In short knowing as many people in the organization as possible. Calling them by their name and genuinely saying hello or asking them how they are doing is a great base for culture. 
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,Please see comments below
Culture Analysis,Improve,"Please stop the locker room talk from senior leadership in front of staff. 

Please stop valuing face-time more than quality of work. If someone arrives at 8:30 and stays until 5:30 every day, senior leadership views them positively. There are many examples of situations where people may need to come in at 9:00 and/or leave early to accommodate their lifestyle needs, and senior leadership ridicules them in front of everyone for ""never working"" or ""slacking off"" or ""must be nice""....this mindset trickles down and sets an abrasive culture for the staff. Our job requires us to work lots of nights, weekends, holidays year-round. We like our jobs and we are happy to work these hours. Why does our senior leadership not recognize how much we flex to the needs of the organization and our jobs, and reciprocate? 


"
Morale Analysis,Improve,"Please take the feedback you receive in these surveys and process it, rather than react. 

There are lots of great things about this organization, but this survey asks for suggestions on improvement. 

Please don't view these comments and suggestions as ""complaining"" or ""crying"". We like working here, we want people to stay working here, we have great people who work here....however, it seems senior leadership doesn't recognize this.

Please make feedback a part of our culture. We want to share feedback to our leadership about their style and management skills. However, our organization doesn't foster a safe environment to practice a consistent feedback loop (both positive and constructive criticism) for our senior leadership. 

In many cases, exit interviews are the first time employees have been asked to ""rate"" their executive leadership. We can't expect people to answer honestly or feel safe completing an honest exit interview when their feedback hadn't been requested or valued while they were employed here. "

Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,"Professionalize the experience. From entrance to exit, how can the experience of going to work feel professional/classy/respected?!?"
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve,"Provide a coffee budget for the first floor!  I feel like this is a simple thing that a lot of companies provide to their employees. There is a VERY kind person on the first floor who supplies most of our coffee needs and never asks for compensation. Some of us do try to give him money for this effort, but i'm sure he ends up spending more out of pocket then what is given back to him! Would love if the Reds could provide the budget for this. I'm not sure who's budget the K-Cups on the 2nd and 3rd floor come out of, but would be nice to have the same provided for 1st floor employees. "
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,"Providing a lunch option to front office employees at the stadium would be one way to strengthen our culture and tie together Business Operations and Baseball Operations. Other teams offer a weekday cafeteria-style lunch that gives employees the time and place to get to know one another. If this is ever put into place, I would suggest the food quality be of a higher quality than what is served for press box pregame dining."

Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,"Ran out of time, need more targeted questions. (but, I will say, the ""Total Rewards"" thing earlier this year was hilarious -- maybe each employee should send a receipt of all of their work items delivered in the last year back the other way, too, lol)"

Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,Really nothing. I've really enjoyed working here. I've had some minor technical gripes from time to time but those are to be expecting working in my role.

Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,Recognition is important! Employees love to be recognized for a job well done. Please continue to do so.
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,"Recognitions are good, but the bonus that ownership decided to approve at the end of 2022 was great!!"
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,"Reduce micromanaging from the executive level. I am not directly micromanaged, but my boss is and it has a negative influence on them. I then am sometimes tasked with things from the executive level that do not fall in line with how we would normally perform our duties or things that have a negative impact on our performance metrics. We were hired to do our jobs because we are good at what we do. Let us cook."
Morale Analysis,Improve/Good,"Reducing micromanaging, as I mentioned before, applies here as well. Also, more PTO would be nice. I've heard of other workplaces that have unlimited PTO with manager approval. Maybe that is a little extreme, but we work 9-5 and then some. We don't get to bank any extra PTO based on the extra hours we work, so we push aside basic life needs like spending weekends with family or taking care of home/auto issues or having time to do laundry. Missing out on or delaying those things definitely causes extra stress. Maybe a mandatory work-at-home day every month could help, as well."
Morale Analysis,Improve/Good,Remain competitive in benefits and compensation.
Reward & Recognition,Improve,"Remote employees do not seem to get the same level of recognition for their accomplishments, and greater efforts need to be taken in order to make remote employees a part of the Reds family."

Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,"Rewards and recognition for employees should be presented 5 minutes before Friday and Saturday during homestands, not 30 or more, before home games.. should be on the field at home plate.. not Monday thru Thursday games.. "
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,"Rewards are done departmentally, which are appreciated, but nothing necessarily as an organization. Don't get me wrong, the Skyline lunch, Christmas lunch and gifts are great and appreciated, but I don't see those as rewards. Recognition is done throughout the organization. That is appreciated and about right for a company our size. 

If you can do anything, look to strengthen the rewards across the organization. We do performance reviews for really no purpose. There is no reward for going above and beyond, so doing the basic same stuff gets you 4% or 3% or whatever the yearly increase is. Create a true goal incentive program for bonuses/additional vacation, etc. "
Morale Analysis,Improve,"Same as above. When our tech doesnt work, it affects our players as our attention is not 100% dedicated to them."
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,"See answers above and below - we can continue to improve our culture by lowering the hours demands on staff through additional hiring availability, recognizing employees through greater financial incentives and making them feel a part of something building towards a first-class organization by trusting them with the information that is at the core of our business.
On a more specific note, the use of so many communications channels is becoming a detriment to our culture since they are ""always on"" and it can be tough to feel comfortable getting away from slack/text/email/phone when there is always activity on one or many of those platforms

Morale Analysis,Improve,"Senior leadership needs to listen and be responsive to (continuous) feedback. We need an outlet to provide feedback (a recurring survey or other drop box… ideas can come about at any time; we wont think of every little thing on this particular survey). And employees at the lowest levels can have the best ideas/feedback since they are the ones with boots on the ground, but leadership needs to listen and be receptive. My general attitude/outlook on the Reds would vastly improve if I knew we were open to feedback and making continuous improvements."

Morale Analysis,Very Good,"Show employees they're valued, respected and trusted. Treat them like adults and they will act like adults. I feel like the Reds are starting to make strides in the right direction in showing employees they're valued.

Morale Analysis,Improve/Good,Show true appreciation and be respectful.  
Morale Analysis,Improve,"Simple things.  Many feel they work the hardest, but always the least commended.    All gratitude is for the Directors, not staff.   Can Phil and Karen walk through each floor and learn or care to learn everyone's name and just say hello?   

How about updates on the team performance, years ago received voicemail from GM Wayne K. every day/every other on team status, etc. - you felt connected to the team. 

Connection within Departments - no outings since Pre-Covid and interest from Manager just not present to unite new member with old members."
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,"Since pay is something that would be tough to increase, more flexibility in working from home would be nice. This is something FREE to company could do to help with employee morale, the culture and rewards and recognition (covering all areas of this survey). This could also be used as a recruiting tool with incoming FT hires. Some of us are doing the job of multiple people, so eliminating our commute and in-office interruptions would give us time back to work longer and more efficiently.  Almost every other club allows their employees to work remotely 2-3 times a week. This would be a HUGE employee benefit and would truly make an impact with the staff. If someone chooses not to WFH and wants to be in-office, that is fine, but the rest of us who would benefit from that opportunity shouldn't be denied the opportunity because of a few people who don't want or believe in it. 


We are running out of space and cramming people into areas that arent built for that many people. Working from home would help with this issue, especially if departments that dont need to be in the office at all could work remotely most of the time. I understand having people from each department in the office at all times, so if there is an issue, someone is on-site but having a rotating scheduled for those departments who dont have in-office duties would be a nice benefit. It would eliminate the need for a desk for every person who doesn't have in-office or game day duties. "

Morale Analysis,Improve,"Sometimes the volume of work turns work into a factory production line of sorts that results in a focus on just getting what is in front of you done so that you can move to the next ""to do"" on the list.  While this approach finds work getting done, it may not be the most productive in terms of overall quality of work.  "
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,Sometimes there can be too much process and other times not enough. I would evaluate certain areas to determine where some current procedures can be reduced or eliminated and conversely where some can be added to improve outcomes. Work orders work with some departments and not with others. It can be where projects go to die especially when some use them and others do not.

Morale Analysis,Improve,"The attitude and level of job satisfaction each employee has can influence the overall outlook and employee morale within an organization. 

I feel overwhelmed much of the time with too many responsibilities for the position that I hold and I know that I am not alone in that feeling. Many of us are expected to do a job that under normal business circumstances is held by several people. I observe my co-workers under pressure to keep up with the workload only to get more projects added, thwarting any kind of meaningful progress. I experience that myself as well. A lot of effort is put into doing too many things that essentially can be distilled down to unimportant work, which in turn leads to poor productivity, a narrow focus, and frustrated morale.

I think to improve this, leadership should look at the workload being asked of staff and re-evaluate whether it is reasonable, and if not, re-assign or re-organize as needed. 

I don't think it is as important to reward employees or recognize them in a public way as it is to have the trust of leadership to make decisions without the fear of repercussion. A job well done is what ultimately leads to job satisfaction. And to do a job well, there has to be recognition from leadership that comes in the form of how one is treated and trusted. 

Encouraging us to take time away to maintain a healthy work/life balance will do much to improve morale.
"
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,"The biggest issue I have with our culture is we keep trying to reinvent the wheel. Ball park maintenance has always taken care of things as they come up and the rest of the staff tend to text us, email, and verbally give us issues to fix. It seems like every few years someone freaks out and tries to create a formal submission system and have us force this system on everyone and there is a handful of people who outright refuse to use it and probably will never conform. "
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,"The communication and recognitions have been great but ultimately, employees seek competitive compensation as the biggest reward.

One recommendation is to change the language on the new Reds reward mailer to not list employee salary as a reward, as a salary is earned income and this can be interpreted in a negative fashion.  "
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,"The cross learning is a benefit in this area as well. We have many different countries, thus cultures, being integrated under the Reds umbrella.

As such, people behave as professionals and take pride in the responsibility of doing a good job.

Morale Analysis,Improve,"The morale of the staff took a significant hit when the NUPP was removed as a benefit.  Our owner repeatedly stated multiple times to our department in person that the NUPP would be a mainstay and to not worry about eliminating the benefit.  Although I believe the decision to remove the NUPP from our benefits was not taken lightly, however, I dont believe ownership realized how much this decision severely impacted employee morale and I dont believe the morale can get back to previous levels.  In short, losing the NUPP was and remains a morale killer especially for those employees that have been loyal to the Reds."
Morale Analysis,Improve,"The morale within my department is awful. There is bad work ethic, poor behaviors and an ""I don't care attitude"". There is no feeling of worth for employees and no feeling of value within the department. Employees have a no one cares about us attitude due to lack of leadership. In order to fix this, management must start to value their employees. They can do this through helping employees prepare for the next step in their careers. Currently it seems as though no one on staff could move into a leadership position if one was available. Create a program that employees could enroll in that would allow them to get training for management positions, programs that allow employees to be apart of the decision process of smaller decisions.  "
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve,"The number one topic of discussion ALWAYS comes back to workload demand and the lack of staffing to keep up with the growing workload.

Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,"The only recognition I have seen is in the SWAY newsletter and at the employee luncheons.  It seems like they are afraid to do individual recognition at the luncheon because there are difficult names to pronounce, so most of the recognition is by department.  I think the best way of recognition is POSITIVE feedback from supervisors.  Its rare to get that.  Im not talking about public recognition and in front of people.  Just a nice great job on something the employee does would be nice.
The Reds Way is great for the seasonal employees.  Could there be something for the many managers, full time workers and others working above and beyond using the Redsway?  I'm a big believer in the Reds Way.  Also there hasn't been any training that I have seen for the new employees this year.  Just the day of orientation.

Culture Analysis,Improve,"The only system that needs a touch of adjustment is the upper management. There are times that we get burnt out or do not feel creative because upper management wants it a certain way, or projects have to go through multiple people before ever getting approved. It would be so great if we were trusted as employees. I understand that some projects will be executive level heavy, but other smaller projects that are for fun and entertainment has to go through a ridiculous process of approval. All that does is drain the passion from creative people - ultimately we stop thinking and it comes down to an attitude of ""just tell me what you want - I'll stop exercising my creativity - just tell me what you want"". That needs to change. We were hired for a reason. Please trust us to make great decisions and be creative. "

There will always be a small percentage of situations that require the attention of staff to be redirected, and that is understandable, and many times manageable. It is the balance of reactive situations - the ones we create ourselves - that many times results in confusion, exhaustion and misguided directives."

Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,The Reds do a good job! Maybe cards for b-days/anniversaries/promotions with a small gift card or something for recognition. 
Culture Analysis,Improve,"The Reds have a good culture.  This is supported by the large number of employees who have 10+ years tenure.  Working for 1 of 30 MLB Clubs is special.  It is truly an honor.  
The Reds have done a lot to improve the culture.   That doesnt go unnoticed.  Because weve built a culture based on constant improvement here are a few suggestions:
Lead with trust.  Our core values are a good step in that equation.  We need Accountability, Adaptability and Collaboration to help us build trust amongst each other and with our leaders, yet it feels like senior leadership doesnt fully trust VP level and downward.
SVP and VP level executives have serious trust issues interdepartmentally.  It appears that every other departments needs are more important than the others.  It appears that departmental requests or process changes are a burden to other departments rather than an attempt to improve the entire organization. This needs to be fixed if we want to grow and develop the next crop of leaders.

Empower employees as far down the chain of command as possible to say yes.  Because we are an organization focused on image over all else, so often employees  are scared to make a mistake.  

Senior Leaders should consistently do things to develop their individual leadership.  Then share and coach those learnings to their peers/direct reports.  Almost Senior Leader (VP and higher), that Ive worked with, has an incredible mind and skillsets for operating and growing our business.   Deficiencies appears in the management and leadership of people.  There are many easy ways to grow and develop your leadership skills.  Books, Podcasts, Personality and strength/weakness assessments, outside agencies or trainers that teach and coach leadership.  This can be done individually or as a group.  Let the principles learned in this development cast a vision for the entire organization.  Put that vision in writing.  Send it to every employee. Speak that vision on a consistent basis.  This will create more committed followers and ultimately empower your work force.

"
Morale Analysis,Improve,"The Reds have provided a great place to work, as evidenced by the number of staff members with long tenures. The lack of on-field success does weigh heavily on us all and can make it challenge to wear a smile and get excited to give our best. The benefits summary was a great idea - but presented in a 'look at all we give you' way that rubbed many the wrong way. "
Better Place to Work Analysis,Very Good,The Reds is a great place to work overall - they offer some great benefits. 
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,"The Reds need a consistent policy for all departments regarding working remotely because right now some departments allow their people to work from home while other departments are not allowing it.  

Make work/life balance for all staff who work games a formal organizational priority, verses leaving it a gray area for midlevel and higher personnel.
  "
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,The Reds organization needs to get back to pre-Covid staff numbers. There are departments that are generating as much or more revenue than pre-2020 and yet the staff size is half of what it was. This is forcing the current employees to have the workload of what traditionally was required of 2-3 people; ultimately leading to burnout. 
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve,"The Reds preach adaptability as a core value - however it feels as if the changing priorities of the workforce, namely the ask for adaptability and flexibility, is still an uphill battle. Those with game responsibilities agree and understand those positions require nights and weekends and don't bat an eye working a non-traditional schedule. However, it still feels as if there is an expectation to report to work at 8:30a and stay until 5:30p. It's understood that, as an organization that sells and services a product, the building needs to be open to service current and prospective clients as well as the other activities around the stadium. It would go a long way toward retaining our staff if there was an organizational improvement regarding the flexibility of being in the office."
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,The rewards that are given for these good performances and behaviors could be increased to give more incentive.

Better Place to Work Analysis,Very Good,"The work/life balance will always be a challenge in this business.    Outside of continuing to work on that, I do not feel that there is anything else in reason that can be provided.  

"
Morale Analysis,Improve/Good,"The working suite during home weekday games will really help increase morale in baseball ops, as I mentioned in the first question"
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve,"There are a lot of things that could be done here, some more realistic than others. I think a lot of the ways things could be improved stem from the fact that we have A LOT going on at all times and we just simply are not staffed appropriately in all areas. Most departments are very lean, in that it's like a basketball team with a strong starting 5 and little bench. When all the starters are in and healthy and being able to play almost the whole game, they're tough to beat. But if someone gets hurt or someone gets into foul trouble and has to miss time, it's very tough to make up for. What that translates to our world is that if we have someone leave or if someone is on vacation for a week or has to miss time unexpectedly for some reason, there's not enough backup or cushion in the staffing to make up for that. Every part of the engine is running at 100% (or more) at all times. We need to have more positions to create more areas for improvement and upward mobility. There's so many positions that could essentially be 2 full-time positions and still be plenty busy. Yes, maybe sometimes their work would be light but there's nothing wrong with positions having slow periods. "
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,There doesn't seem to be much interaction between those working on the baseball-side and those on the business-side
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve,"There is no trust between the corner offices and the organization.  It is broken and in need of repair for lots of reasons. Its starts with the culture change of focusing on what went right vs. what went wrong.  Give three compliments for every one criticism. The Reds have a fear based/C.Y.A culture. We tend to be quick to focus on what went wrong in all situations and then look to blame those who made the decision.  It's okay to provide coaching and feedback about a decision after it is made, but it must be approached from a seek to understand and make better vs. condescending and blame standpoint.  "
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,"There should be at least 2 collaborative initiatives each season that Community Relations, Community Fund, Ticket Sales, Marketing, HOF and other supporting departments should participate in planning. There are departments that seem more secluded from others and lack knowledge cross-sectionally on what services other departments have to offer. "
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,These programs are small positives overall but I don't feel they substantially improve employee morale over the long term. Acknowledgements in the form of bonuses and/or raises above and beyond cost of living adjustments would be a way to translate exceptional work into a tangible recognition for employees.

Reward & Recognition,Improve,"These reward/recognitions feel forced upon the employees. Hey let's celebrate this person's success by having lunch for them, by the way, it's also taking time away from their important work or that person also can't make it. The hardest working people in the organization are the ones that never have the time for celebrations, they already know they are doing a great job, they don't need the recognition for it. If you want to reward the employees, doing it monetarily will always serve well. Not a gift card to the Reds cafeteria (Holy Grail) across the street or any other local food chain in the area. That's just too easy and not thoughtful.  "
Reward & Recognition,Very Good,"These things are great. More importantly, recognizing employees hard work through better compensation and growth opportunities means the most. The newsletter that HR puts out is also great in acknowledging employees lives outside of work as well as growth within the workplace. "
Morale Analysis,Improve/Good,Think of ways to keep staff engaged during losing streaks. I hear we used to have lunches catered a lot and have HH's led by Phil when team is good. I understand the excitement that comes from success but isn't it just important to do when we're struggling?
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,"Think the Reds do a pretty good job with this. Would maybe just look at the rewards offered for the various milestones (5, 10, etc...) as I think most folks would rather have something other than a gift card to the team shop or items/gift cards from Tiffany's. Gift cards to Amazon, Kroger, etc... or other more practical items to choose from other than expensive tie clips, bowls, etc... would be much more beneficial and practical for most. "
Morale Analysis,Improve,"This goes to the previous statement of letting the people do their work and trusting employees that the job will get done. I think of several projects when a department has worked on a project and completely bashed by the department head, almost in laughing, sarcastic matter. I'm sure the strength of morale takes a shot in everyone in the department. The stress, anxiety, mental health takes a toll on everyone. 

I would also like to see people within the organization be open to new and fresh ideas instead of proceeding as normal, the creative juices that make an employee best are gone after repeated no's or hard no's. Especially when other teams advancing with creative ways of innovating baseball for fans. There are so many great things we could be doing but most of it is recycled ideas from other teams. The talent is great at this place, however when people keep getting ideas turned down repeatedly, the more people start to leave the organization. Don't get me wrong, most people love working with their direct coworkers, it's just when other people get involved and have completely different opinions and because they have more tenure at this place, it's their way or the highway. Sure it is easy to say that it can be changed, but employees have been asking for this for years now, it still hasn't changed. Employees are just better off silent because they know it's not worth getting rejected time after time again.

Side note, most people are overworked at this place, especially with people leaving for other opportunities (even if those are not the greatest), most of those positions have gone to other employees to take care of, leaving employees working two jobs at the same time. Of course the stress, anxiety, mental health takes a toll on these people and it affects everyone else. Just make sure to compensate your employees fairly. It is another key reason why employees are leaving. "
Culture Analysis,Improve,"This is a very macho workplace. I don't mind it so much, but I know many others really despise how many F bombs are dropped in meetings, in a very public nonchalant manner. I know cuss words are becoming more and more informal, and I use them too, but they are worked into the vernacular of Reds C-level executives so much.  It can create an intimidating workplace for those that are uncomfortable around that language. 

I would NEVER recommend a female friend apply for a job here.  And given how many females have left recently, I think it backs up my assertion that it's not a good place for women.

- Also, no adult should ever be yelled at here.  It's demoralizing and makes you feel like a child.  I know MANY people who have quit, or wanted to quit, because of the demoralizing way a boss has treated them.  Our jobs aren't THAT important.  We aren't saving lives here, we just want people to come watch our baseball team play.  C-Level executives should not be so intimidated by our that it makes them lose their mind on a lower level employee because of something. Happens way too often."
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,"This is all important, but doing good work with good people and financial incentives around doing good work are the biggest drivers of my need for rewards or recognitions. "
Culture Analysis,Very Good,"This is an area I believe we do excel extremely well at personally.  While I cannot speak for other departments, our department in particular has worked hard over the last couple years to grow into a more cohesive unit.  The ""bad eggs"" have been removed, and we are as close a group as I have been a part of since joining the Reds.  The group we have makes you wake up and look forward to working each day."
Culture Analysis,Very Good,This is hard to pick one or two things that will help strengthen the culture. I feel that culture happens organically over time. The more the personalities involved believe in each other and believe in what they are all about. they create the vibe that bonds them together. Then the org culture acronyms hold a deeper meaning.
Reward & Recognition,Very Good,This is not an area that requires strengthening.  
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,"This is so hard to define. But I work remotely so its especially hard. But it would be nice if there was more space in the office so I could work at the office occasionally. For those out of state, it would be nice to travel into Cincy more often. Also, Id like there to be better availability of premium tickets."
Morale Analysis,Improve/Good,"This is the bucket in need to the most work. Team performance obviously hasn't been great which is certainly tied to morale but there are other things not dependent on team success that could boost morale. See below for several thoughts:
A huge item for me to improve morale would be the tinkering of the work hours/setup. For folks with kids who live in the suburbs, the 5:30pm end of the day is tough. Makes it hard to get to practices without leaving early which then leads to a feeling of guilt and a need need to work later in the evening to make up that time. Also makes having quality  time with family (which is already tough due to night and weekend work) and time for other non work related needs (cutting grass for example) challenging. When the team is on the road and/or the offseason I would love to see some exploration into something other than our traditional 8:30-5:30 9-hour in person office days. Would LOVE work from home options when able given that most other companies are now offering this option in come capacity and seeing increased employee happiness and no dip in productivity. Realize this is loaded but 10+ hour days including a commute that keep the average employee gone from before 8am to after 6pm is a lot 5 days a week when you are also working nights and weekends. Leads to burnout. Work weeks should still average 40 hours but could be done in alternate, more accommodating ways.
The decor and furniture on the 2nd/3rd floor is updated and much more modern than the long wall of pictures from the 1980/1990s that serve as the only real art on the 1st floor. Feel like the entire 1st floor lacks personality when walking through it and comes off as very boring. Would love an update to the 1st floor decor which has looked outdated for quite some time. This would include the common areas and the offices (where most of the walls have no color and the floors have ugly brown carpet).

Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,This might already occur but potential free tickets to premium seats for high achievers or gift card to team shop.
Culture Analysis,Very Good,This year has proved better than in the past. I feel that we are headed in right direction. 
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,TIME. But it is very difficult to reward staff with time away from the office when all it does is put us behind. We cannot talk about work/life balance until we address the workload/staffing. Less workload or more staff. Either one of those solutions will allow the organization to better reward and recognize its employees.
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,"To begin, the Cincinnati Reds are overall a good place to work which is displayed by the tenure in many departments. That said, I think we have an opportunity to catch up to the rest of the workforce & flex to the needs/wants of incoming & existing personnel.
1.	PROMOTE & CELEBRATE DE&I: The Reds do not promote a culture of diversity & inclusion well. To begin, I have rarely received assistance hiring diverse talent or talent in general. Therefore, I and our team dedicate a significant amount of time to recruiting talent and building our pipeline. It is recognized by diverse hires that they are the “only” & that should not be the case. We can do better & should do better. It is not as “cool” to work at the Reds as it once was & at times, its embarrassing. Our candidate pools reflect this & hiring talent in general, let alone diverse talent, is extremely difficult. 
2.	PROMOTE & CELEBRATE WOMEN: There is not equal gender representation at the VP & Executive Level. I do not believe the Reds prioritize recruiting or retaining women. I have witnessed numerous instances where individuals above the VP level have made derogatory comments about the female population. As someone who has aspired or sometimes still aspires to grow within the organization, this is disheartening & deflating. 
From what I have witnessed, being a working mother at the Reds is even harder - especially if you come from a dual-working parent household (which does not affect many, if any, at the VP level & higher currently). The Reds are currently 1 of only 7 MLB teams that do not offer a standardized work from home policy. Working from home 1+ day/week along with allowing for individualized flexibility would make this a better place to work for moms/parents/everyone. In most homes, the core responsibility for children is with the mother. This involves getting your kids on the bus or to and from daycare. 8:30-5:30 business hours dont always work within that & that should not reflect poorly on that individual. We have lost A LOT of great women in recent years. Its sad. When there are only met at the top, our voices will never be heard.
 "
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,To make sure our message/mission statement is present and forward in all our both public and private interactions
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve,"To put it in simple terms, if Reds employees were as valued as Reds season ticket members, this survey wouldn't be necessary.

Employees (especially workers with gameday responsibilities) put in long hours and are usually on the front lines when things go sideways. They don't work here for the pay, as the wages here aren't competitive, rather they work here because of the pride of of being a Cincinnati Red. 

My suggestion is for every Reds executive to read Bob Howsam's book ""My Life in Sports."" And if you want to improve the workplace for employees (who aren't executives), treat them how current season ticket members are being treated."
Morale Analysis,Improve,"To strengthen morale would have to be pay and not feeling like I dont have the opportunity to advance. Over the past 6 months Ive had 4 interviews with an NFL team with pretty much the same position I do here but it was very frustrating seeing how much they value my skill set to here. It was about a $20,000 difference and theyre the same size city and cost of living is very similar to here. Was just very frustrating."

Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve,"Trust is huge with all businesses. I have heard many times that staff does not trust confidential and anonymous surveys to be just that. And as a result, organizations can't get the proper data to improve processes, ideas, or practices. I hope that isn't the case this time and that my input can be helpful.

For any organization to work well, leadership should empower employees to make decisions and help them if they need it. Leadership should trust that the person hired can do the job they are hired to do and as such empower them to make decisions so there are no unnecessary delays in business. This will foster a more cohesive relationship altogether. 

Effective collaboration is essential to making a workplace thrive. It builds good morale. It has to be effective and essential to make an impact. Adapting is most useful if it is applied at a time that isn't just reactive. Accepting change is key, but consistently adapting to unnecessary circumstances isn't adapting effectively, it is an example of scrambling and usually does not offer the best outcome.

The point is that you can have the best concepts to work from but if they aren't applied correctly, they won't be effective. "

Morale Analysis,Improve,"Trust your leadership team 
•	Trusting your leadership team would help lessen our “culture of fear”
•	We are often so micromanaged for fear of making a mistake, the details are nitpicked 
•	Trust your people to do the right thing, and then stand back and let them do it
•	When you trust your people, you can also empower them to take control of their own work and make decisions for themselves, which alleviates your own workload 
•	Meet failures with support and development opportunities, instead of retaliation and yelling

Stop making jokes about “Reds Promotion means more work, no more pay.”
•	When an employee is promoted to manager, they do not clock in and out. They are no longer monitored to 40 hours per week (and arent paid for overtime). These managers are now required to work more hours games, nights, weekends plus non-game day events and then must come back for early morning meetings….which is completely understandable. However….
•	The facilitator/approver of manager flexibility doesnt allow them to come in late, leave early or take a day off without putting in PTO or fear of jokes/retaliation for being out of the office. 
•	Our young and wonderful staff values promotions and title changes. Even though it is true many promotions do not come with salary increases, and require more work….it is very off-putting when jokes are made and supported/repeated by leadership.

Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve,"Unfortunately it seems like management doesn't value employees who actually care about the Reds, the organization and making sure the fans are taken care of in a way that makes them want to return. I think management can do a better job in leading their departments to enrich their employees who will feel valued and will then go out and do the job at extremely high levels.

Just putting ""a body in the seat"" is unacceptable in a organization that preaches high values, that mindset must be eradicated. "

The stadium is mostly empty almost every night. Most suites go unused for most games. Give departments access to them, hand out some food vouchers, and let people enjoy something that would otherwise be wasted. Intermingle departments so people get to know each other outside of work contexts and perhaps across groups that never would've interacted otherwise.

Use the field more - invite families to camp out there and play a movie on the scoreboard. Have a regular game of softball or something. There is no chance it will cause noticeable damage, and if it occasionally does, that's why we have a grounds crew.

Integrate the business side into baseball more. Give them regular, actual updates (optional attendance, not mandatory) on how the team is doing, top-to-bottom and let them ask questions of baseball leadership. Spread the responsibility out between various baseball departments - operations, analytics, scouting, player development, sports science; we're here for baseball, make sure people know about baseball.

Many of us are still reeling from losing our pension, on top of low wages already accepted for working in professional sports (which is what we signed up for). Perhaps a little bed side manner would go a long way. Understand your workers, figure out what matters to them, walk in their shoes from time to time.

And because people are constantly talking over and/or interrupting each other, we end up rewarding the loudest voice in the room at the expense of potentially better business ideas. I regularly experience meetings or individual conversations where I make a choice to remain quiet rather than fight through a crowd of loud voices. This is a systemic part of our culture that starts at the top and is persistent throughout all levels of the organization."

Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,"We have our own rewards in Scouting, not sure about the office"
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,"We have several people throughout the organization who do their jobs at a high level but are rarely if ever, recognized for it. We should have employees of the month or at least a simple note from someone saying they are aware of the work we are doing. We are often only told about the things we aren't doing well. We should get more positive feedback from front office members more often. It is easy to feel like we are just spinning our wheels in the minor leagues when we do things the way we are asked and still don't win games and don't get recognized for doing our jobs well inside of the parameters we have been given, or we could change the parameters we have to work within and actually try to win in the minor leagues. "
Morale Analysis,Improve,"We have started to improve but we are still falling short for our employees well-being and quality of life in two ways:
- Competitiveness of compensation not just relative to baseball but to the overall job market in Cincinnati and the country as a whole
- Limitations on hiring that do not allow for reasonable on-call hours for certain staff. Employees should be able to make themselves unavailable for a manageable number of hours every week and feel confident that there is someone else on the staff that can handle any issues that arise while they are offline."
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,"We have too many tech issues daily as a field staff. Our time is limited due to our on field activities. Computer issues, software issues daily, older equipment, etc. this makes our multiple responsibilities very hard to accomplish daily."
Morale Analysis,Improve,We need a culture of winning and that starts on the field.
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,"We need to consolidate our communication platforms. We have too many places to go to find messages and it creates a disconnect from front office to the field. Slack is proven to be the best communication platform, and it isn't close. TeamWorks is an absolute abomination and makes it impossible to share the content with our players that we would like. 
Not having DEI forced down our throats has been nice. 
More interdepartmental communication would be good. Too often other departments don't know enough about other departments so games/development are stifled because not enough people are willing to learn about other departments.
When it comes to discussing players and what needs to change within the minor league system people are afraid of the truth. Certain people don't want to hear the truth if it goes against their preconceived notions about a player. We need to be able to speak more freely about players.  "
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,"We need to encourage and all for more long term planning. Part of that comes from what I mentioned above about staffing and allowing for some people to find more strategic opportunities because less of their time is spent on day-to-day. We are an organization that is all about ""player coaches"" but we need to find a way to balance that out some more where there's more coach time and less player time for some of us. Make a plan, stick to it and eliminate some of the panic and reactionary decisions. "
Culture Analysis,Improve,"We need to maximize collisions (serendipitous encounters that form community and encourage creativity and cohesion) by designing for physical proximity. Practically, we should have more common areas and more opportunity to interact with each other (e.g. breakfast/lunch, vending area, quality coffee machines, etc.  (things that put people in the same place throughout the day). It feels like many departments (generally baseball vs. business) are so divided. In great cultures, everyone talks to everyone. Everybody should be able to talk to anybody is a key tenet of Pixars culture. "
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,"We need to put more criteria around promotions and titles.  It seems as if a hallway conversation with the can result in promotions for people without any thought about the implication to others.   This has to be taken into account across departments since the titles (Manager, Sr. Manager, Director, Sr. Director) are the same in the entire organization. Titles matter as it shows success in a career both internally and externally."
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,We need to win more that strengthens our culture. 
Culture Analysis,Improve,"We operate in a fear-based culture, so concerned with the fear of failure that it can sometimes become stifling and suppress creativity.  Recently, I have had 2 occasions where a Manager, Director, and VP all had to bless an agenda, of all things, before the meetings were held.  We have real business objectives to tackle but are incredibly concerned with making sure we don't fail internally. 

Additionally, our organization is one where the loudest voice in the room wins.  We need to offer a more collaborative environment where the talented professionals on staff are trusted to meet objectives.

The organization was once called ""1/3 sweatshop, 1/3 insane asylum, 1/3 frat house."" While that was a joke, I think about it often, because it's accurate.  We need to have a diversity of opinions and perspectives, it will make us stronger. Our lack of diversity in leadership roles, especially at the VP level, is revealed through the organization's decision making. We would benefit by having more women and people of color in our VP level and higher.  Lastly, there are continual running jokes_______, who ""checks to see if people are working,"" which is incredibly hurtful as we work hard and sacrifice nights and weekends to work here."
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,"We should diversify the staff more in salaried director level positions. The communities that are lacking in the ballpark on game days (ticket sales) are also lacking in the office staff (management-level positions and above). Having more inclusivity and diversity in the staff could aid with the appeal and approach of fan engagement. 

Also, the visibility of players off-field community initiatives/interests should be marketed more often. Fans are more inclined to come if they know who the players are and how they give back. This would help the sales, promotions and supporting departments get people in the ballpark and improve the fan experience. "
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,"We should look to provide a more consistent bonus system for our employees - especially those in the mid-to-lower tier of compensation. Give department managers a pool with which they can choose to reward staff at the end of a long season. Of late it's been nice to see us provide the holiday time gift cards, but I think we're still falling short. Last year we had the one-time bonus for many employees, but I don't think it should be one-time for the ones in our lower salary pool (let's call it under $100,000 per year total comp). Make it universal - something like if you have 40 employees in that category - you have $80,000 to award out, but it doesn't have to be $2,000 per employee. Employees can then strive for that bonus pool through the course of the year with their work. 

Secondly - we should have some sort of FREE snack central. It would not cost that much to make that a thing via Costco all year long. 

I'd also like to bring back some sort of manager review system. It doesn't have to be department specific in my opinion as we work across many departments. We could simply give people and option to go in and provide feedback of any kind to all Director title and above staff if they so choose. 

Lastly - I think our milestone recognitions need to be higher. 5/10/15/20/25/30 years should all come with a cash reward more fitting of the dedication that has been put in to reach those significant years of service. "
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,"We strive for customer intimacy with our season ticket holders and corporate partners. Let's get a better understanding of our full time staff. If someone has been here 10+ years, we should be able to get with their manager/staff and give them a unique gift and/or experience that caters to what they value. Maybe they could go on the corporate fly away trip, maybe they could throw out a first pitch, play in the Marty Golf outing, maybe we could give them a suite for a game to host their family/friends in their honor. 

Employee parking is a great reward, thank you. "

Also, bring back the Kings Island day! The zoo is fun, but I think employees and families enjoy Kings Island more."
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,What are these so called rewards?
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,"When a new employee is hired, depending on their position, they need to shadow game day employees or supervisors to learn the day-to-day ballpark operations duties."
Culture Analysis,Improve,"When individual customers are angry, the Reds go above and beyond to pacify them. Same with members of the media; if they are negative enough, we roll out the red carpet for them. Employees see that and wonder why they should be loyal, honorable, respectful, and dedicated to the organization. 

For example, our radio rightsholder rips the team nightly, yet we invite those folks to emcee Reds events, treat them to perks, etc. I don't think that's the right way to do things.

Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,When you have a good employee take care of them. I know a department that someone asked for a raise did not get it and left and he would be far and away the best at his department. The new people are just not as knowledgeable.
Morale Analysis,Improve,"While I cant speak for other employees, I felt like losing the NUPP was a pretty devastating blow to morale. Having a pension plan is something that separated us from other MLB organizations and other companies in different industries. Losing that retirement benefit can make it difficult to believe the organization truly values you and your work. "
Morale Analysis,Very Good,"While I think morale is already high with the Reds, I think the best way to strengthen morale would be to see more wins on the field, as I think it would give everyone even more purpose in their work if the Reds were fighting for playoff contention or a more serious run into the playoffs."
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,"While the lobby/entrance areas on each floor of our office building are nice, there are a lot of areas throughout the office building that would benefit from being upgraded (e.g., lighting / flooring improvements, etc.)."
Better Place to Work Analysis,Very Good,Will largely be covered in responses below. Given that the intention of this is to find areas of weakness that need improved I want to be clear in saying there are a lot of things this company does that are great – this survey is framed in a way to talk about the things they dont do great which can easily come off as unhappy/angry/etc.. 
Morale Analysis,Improve/Good,Win Baseball Games - Get into the playoff. 
Morale Analysis,Improve,Win games.
Morale Analysis,Improve,Win more games. 
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,"With all of our extra hours of work during the season, I believe that bringing the Reds back up to the industry standard with PTO is important. While having the week off at Christmas is great, I believe that the Reds should start new hires with an additional 15 days of PTO. We take a lot of time and holidays away from our friends and family, so it would be nice to not have to calculate the time I spend with them when available."
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,"With the creation of the HYPE committee, I think we do a good job of having front office events that help with our overall culture. So I suggest just doing more events like they have already planned to help 'our family' feel appreciated. "
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,"With the economy being the way it is, any rewards would be most appreciated in the form of financial compensation."
Reward & Recognition,Improve/Good,Within the ticket department individuals are recognized for excellent performance. But I'm not aware of that being shared across all aspect of the business. 
Morale Analysis,Improve/Good,Work from home as outlined on previous question
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,Work from Home flexibility
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,"work from home options when possible would be great

dining area with drinks/vending machines/coffee/utensils, eating at our desks isn't great"
Morale Analysis,Improve/Good,Work from home options. 
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,"'-Work from home policy. It could be minimal to start - 1-2 days per month. 
"
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,work life blance
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,Work/Life balance doesn't exist for everyone in the organization. hard work and many hours at work only gets you more hard work and many more hours. 
Better Place to Work Analysis,Improve/Good,"Working in sports, trying to establish a work-life balance is tough. I would recommend we implement a more “formal” policy regarding remote work. When its up to individual departments, it has a tendency to seem “unfair”. I think if you established something more formal, youd gain more credibility and could even use as a recruiting tool. What about allowing employees to work from home on Fridays in the off-season? Or maybe offer a condensed 4 day schedule? 

Can we bring back the monthly employee lunches? These were always such a big hit. The drink machines and ice in Press Dining used to be available all the time. Can we bring that back as well?

Id recommend increasing Paternity Leave to at least 2 weeks. This is a typical policy across other companies."
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,Working together with fellow employees to effectively get job activity completed.
Morale Analysis,Improve,"Working with the players and people inside the department is great. Getting outside of our department is tough. There are too many opinions on how we do what we do and people who question the way we develop. 
Working with TeamWorks after games is painstakingly awful. Getting schedules, reports, and scouting information to players is an entire process. Sharing video with players is impossible. Slack is significantly better. "
Culture Analysis,Improve/Good,"Workplace culture could be strengthened by making a concerted effort to hold onto staff long term, whether thats by giving more incentive or pay to stay, which can create a sense of more stability within the organization."
Morale Analysis,Improve,"Workplace moral is a myth. We all have to come to work. Give your employees good flexibility and compensate them well and moral will improve.
